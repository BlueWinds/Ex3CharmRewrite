  Occult thanks to his knowledge of the signs and portents that herald the arrival of demons in Creation. If you want, you can select some Favored Abilities from your Caste’s Ability list, but you can’t take the same Ability as both Caste and Favored. Your choice of Caste and Favored Abilities is important to your character’s development — it’s less expensive to improve selected Abilities, and to learn Charms associated with them.
}{
  \chapter{Character Creation}
}

  Select one of your Caste Abilities and one of your Favored Abilities be a Supernal abilities. Your Supernal Abilities is the emblem of your character’s legend, the thing she is the very best at. You have an easier time learning powerful Charms with your Supernal Abilities than any other Ability - Charms in your Supernal Abilities treat your Essence rating 2 higher than your current rating (to a maximum of 5) for all purposes. You can learn Essence 3 charms in these abilities right off the bat during character creation, and use upgrades to them sooner than otherwise. When your character's essence is 4, then a charm in one of your Supernal Abilities that lets you make (Essence + 2) attacks allows you to make 5 (your real Essence 4 + 2, to a maximum of 5).

\IfFileExists{Ex3Final.pdf}{
  \par Once you've selected Caste, Favored and Supernal, divide 28 dots among your Abilities. Abilities start at 0, and you cannot raise them higher than 3 without spending Experience Points. You must assign at least one dot to each Favored ability. As with her Attributes, you should explain any of her Abilities rated at three or more dots. Did your character train under a great master to achieve her five-dot rating in Melee, or is she a self-taught martial genius?

  \par Lastly, choose four Specialties for your character. Specialties describe specific focus within an Ability.

\begin{sidebar}{Specialties}
  Abilities represent broad knowledge of a given field, but few people go through life without acquiring unique talents and special interests. In Exalted, these areas of expertise are referred to as Specialties. When you make a roll with an Ability that matches an associated Specialty, you can add one die to that roll. Specialties can be somewhat broad, but there must be notable situations where they can’t apply. Melee (Swords) is perfectly acceptable, but Melee (While Armed) or (While Breathing) are not.

  \par Only one Specialty can apply to a single roll, even if your character has more than one that could be useful.
\end{sidebar}

  \subsection*{Step 4: Merits}

    Merits represent a character's assets and quirks, everything from a family business to a stomach that can handle all but the most rancid food and drink. As with Attributes and Abilities, Merits are rated from one to five dots. Remember that although temporary merits come and go during play, those you've purchased (during character creation or with Experience Points) gain a limited amount of plot armor - they're much less likely to fail when you need them most, or wander off of their own accord. For more information on Merits in play, see the Traits chapter.

    \par Assign up to ten dots to your character’s Merits. As with other traits, Merits can shape your character’s background and circumstances, and they can also be consequences of your character’s past. Be sure to tie them into your overall concept. Did your character earn his Ally through a previous act of selflessness? Has being Hideous shaped the way she sees others?
}{}
  \subsection*{Step 5: Charms}
    A Solar’s Charms are natural expressions of her heroic legend, powered by the very Essence of Creation. Can she run for miles without tiring? Can she shoot a diving swallow at a hundred yards? Once you’ve got a mental picture of your character’s legend, pick out {\bf ten} suitable Charms, keeping in mind that each has prerequisites of enlightenment and skill. Don't forget to purchase the Solar Excellency in abilites you want your character to excel at - it's an incredibly powerful charm.

\IfFileExists{Ex3Final.pdf}{
    \par If you took the Martial Arts ability or learn Sorcery (see the Martial Arts and Sorcery chapter for more details), you can also take Martial Arts charms or learn spells, trading in your starting charms on a one-for-one basis.

  \subsection*{Step 6: Intimacies and Limit Trigger}
    Intimacies describe the important parts of your character’s life, from long-held beliefs to feelings toward loved ones or mortal enemies. For more information on Intimacies, see the Traits chapter. Unlike other traits, there’s no limit to how many Intimacies your character can start with, but you must have a minimum of four Intimacies, of which at least one must be Defining, one must be Major, one must be in some way negative (a thing the character opposes or dislikes), and one must be positive (a thing the character supports or likes).

    \par Additionally, all Solar Exalted labor under a Great Curse spoken by the enemies of the gods as the Exalted slew them. As a result, your character has a Limit Trigger, a circumstance in which the lingering curse of the dead ancients may rise to trouble him. Select a Limit Trigger from the choices in the traits chapter, or work with your Storyteller to design your own.
}{}
  \subsection*{Step 7: Experience Points}
    You have 50 Experience Points to spend on anything that makes sense for your concept. Spells are considered Caste or Favored if Occult is. You’re allowed to spend these Experience Points at any time during character creation - to help meet the prerequisites of a Charm in step 5, for example.

  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    Trait & Experience Points\\
    \hline
    Attribute & 8xp per dot\\
    Caste or Favored ability & 3xp per dot\\
    Non-caste and non-favored ability & 4xp per dot\\
    Specialty & 3xp\\
    Merit & 3xp per dot\\
    Willpower & 8xp per dot\\
    Charm or Spell (Caste/Favored) & 8xp\\
    Charm or Spell (Not Caste/Favored) & 10xp\\
  \end{tabular}

\IfFileExists{Ex3Final.pdf}{
  \subsection*{Step 8: Finishing Touches}
    Solars start play with Essence one, Willpower five, and seven Health Levels (-0, -1, -1, -2, -2, -4, and Incapacitated). A Solar’s pool of Personal Essence is ([Essence x 5] + 5), while their Peripheral Essence pool is ([Essence x 10] + 20). These traits are explained in further detail in Chapter Four.

    \par Each Exalt was a human being before he was Chosen, and he remains so after Exaltation. Being Chosen doesn’t make anyone perfect - as powerful as they are, Solars have nothing to guide them beyond what they bring from their mortal lives. Think about your character’s past and what he was like before his Exaltation. How did he see the world? How did he treat other people? How did other people treat him? Who were his allies, enemies, friends, and loved ones? What faiths and philosophies did his people follow? What other influences played a role in his life? No one is an island, least of all one of the Exalted.

    \par As with any life-changing event, Exaltation can have dramatic effects on a person’s worldview. How does your character feel about his Exaltation and the fact that many see him as a dangerous Anathema? In what ways has his Second Breath changed him? What sort of future does he see for himself?

    This Merit bestows ownership of a hearthstone - a gem formed of concentrated geomantic Essence. Most hearthstones are deliberately formed through Essence concentration in manses, but a few naturally form in demesnes or at sites where Essence has worked prodigious miracles upon the land. If the manse’s owner places the hearthstone in a specially-designed socket in an attuned artifact, then the character enjoys the benefits of standing within the manse wherever she goes.

  Hearthstones do not provide any magical powers of their own - they are useful purely as a power source for artifice or as a link to the manse they belong to. The two-dot version of this merit links to a 2-dot manse, and similarly with the 4-dot version.

    \section*{Character Advancement}
  }
  Character growth is expressed with experience points, given out at the end of every session, which players spend to increase characters’ traits, as well as to buy new Charms and spells. These function exactly as they do during character creation - see the Experience Points table in chapter three. Each character gains five experience points at the end of every session. These points may be spent immediately, or saved to be spent later.

  \subsection*{Raising Essence}
  While it’s possible for a character’s Essence rating to increase in a dramatic moment of blazing glory, it’s more common for the growth to take place over the course of days, weeks or even months. Some Solars  retreat into temporary seclusion in order to commune with their inner divinity, spending time atop mountain peaks, desert plateaus or other elevated places to contemplate the face of the Unconquered Sun and their own burgeoning power.

  Characters' Essence ratings increase automatically once they have earned and spent enough experience points on other traits. Essence is the core of a Solar’s power, the beating heart of his enlightened will, and it becomes stronger only when the Solar has grown as an overall hero of Creation, rather than being cultivated directly. The numbers on this table include the starting experience from character creation.

  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    Essence & Experience Points\\
    \hline
    \(\bullet\bullet\) & 100xp\\

  \section*{Craft Rules}
}
  \par Basic projects are the simplest tasks a craftsman can undertake, such as making a chair, forging basic tools, shoeing a horse, cooking a meal, or fletching an arrow. They are resolved with a single roll. The character works for an amount of time deemed appropriate by the Storyteller, usually ranging from several minutes to several hours, then makes an (Attribute + Craft) roll against a difficulty set by the Storyteller.

  \par Major projects are significant endeavors within a craftsman's trade, anything larger or more complex than a wheelbarrow. They include forging suits of armor, preparing a banquet fit for a prince's table or a god's festival, or sculpting a statue. They are resolved by extended rolls with no fixed terminus, where each roll represents an expenditure of time and materials.

  \par Essence-wielders may also attempt to create Artifacts and Manses, which do have a terminus set by the crafter's available resources. The difficulty, interval and goal number are determined by artifact rating. These intervals assume about four hours of work each day, but cannot be decreased by spending more time working (though a character would work on multiple projects simultaneously if they had nothing else to do).

  \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
    Artifact & Diff & Interval & Goal \# \\
  \hline
    \(\bullet\bullet\) & 3 & Two Weeks & 25 \\
    \(\bullet\bullet\bullet\) & 4 & One Month & 30 \\
    Manse & 4 & One Month & 30\\
    \(\bullet\bullet\bullet\bullet\) & 5 & Two Months & 40 \\
    \(\bullet\bullet\bullet\bullet\bullet\) & 5 & One Season & 50 \\
    Greater Manse & 5 & Two Seasons & 50 \\
  \end{tabular}

  \par As an alternate rule - which should be discussed between all the players (including the Storyteller) before the game begins - replace the Interval of artifact creation with time spent playing. This may work better for exceptionally fast-paced games with little downtime between adventures.

  \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
    Artifact & Alternate Story-based Interval \\
  \hline
    \(\bullet\bullet\) & Twice per Session \\
    \(\bullet\bullet\bullet\) & Once per Session \\
    Manse & Once per Session \\
    \(\bullet\bullet\bullet\bullet\) & Twice per Story \\
    \(\bullet\bullet\bullet\bullet\bullet\) & Once per Story \\
    Greater Manse & Once per Story \\
  \end{tabular}

  \par To find the terminus for an Artifact-creation roll, add together the factors for their workshop and their materials. If you're missing either, you can't even start.

  Workshop
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 1 rolls for a basic workshop, with all the standard tools. A character using Craftsman Needs No Tools has this level of workshop for most projects. However, manses and extremely large Artifacts may require large numbers of labourers as part of the “workshop”.
    \item 2 rolls for a master's workshop, which contains a high-quality example of every tool a normal craftsman in the field would ever want.
    \item 3 rolls for a supernaturally excellent workshop. These are rare in Creation, but a few Dynasts and gods and other stranger things have them.
  \end{itemize}

  Materials
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 2 rolls for having a bit of magical material.
    \item 3 rolls for having some magical material and a few thematically appropriate wondrous ingredients.
    \item 4 rolls for having plenty of magical materials and at least one genuinely impressive wondrous ingredient.
  \end{itemize}

  Other
  \begin{itemize}
    \item +1 roll for working with a master assistant or a team of competent workers.
    \item +2 rolls for working with supernaturally excellent help.
    \item +1 roll for taking four times as much time as is standard.
    \item +1 roll for having an Ability related to the Artifact at 5, or at 3 with a relevant specialty.
    \item +1 roll for having a Charm, spell, anima power, or other magical ability that's related to the Artifact.
  \end{itemize}

  \par If you lose access to something that increases your terminus while working on an Artifact, you may either put the project on hold until you replace it or just accept the reduced terminus. If you use up all of your rolls, all is not lost. Ask the ST what you have to do to earn another roll. Chances are it won't be easy.

\pgWithOverlay{245}{1.75}{1.45}{3.3}{3.3}{Repairing a broken artifact is generally as difficult as creating one a dot lower in rating, except that the interval may be significantly shorter depending on how extensive the damage is. Legendary artifacts, which go beyond the five dot scale, use difficulties, intervals and goal numbers chosen by the Storyteller - not all Legendary Artifacts are created equal, but they're all very difficult.

\vspace{12pt} Craft can also be used to assess crafted items. This is a simple action requiring a (Perception + Craft) roll. With a success the crafter can determine how old an item is, how well it's made, what it's made of, and what condition it's in, and other similar information. A strong success may also allow the crafter to identify the maker if their style is distinctive.}

The Exalted are mighty. Some break swords upon their skin or shatter stone with their fists while others sing songs that move the rocks themselves to tears. As they grow into the fullness of their power, they may form new reality out of primordial chaos, single handedly rout armies or step through shadows and minds in search of secrets

\par These powers and more are represented as Charms, tidy little packages of name, flavor and mechanical effect the game wraps around your character's supernatural prowess. This abstraction is just that - an abstraction. Simply put, we talk about Charms as power and magic and techniques, but when a player has her character use Monkey Leap Technique, the Solar leaps high enough to clear a rooftop - but the character is simply applying their skill at athletics. Charms aren't magic spells. Those who behold a Solar throwing aside a boulder would remark on her incredible strength, but not her use of Increasing Strength Exercise or Thunder's Might.

\subsection*{Minimums}
\par Solar charms all require a minimum level of skill in their associated ability, and many of them expand on earlier charms in that ability. A character must meet all of a charm's Prereqs before she can learn it. Some charms offer also repurchases - by buying a charm additional times, a character can unlock further power.

\par Charms in your Supernal Abilities treat your Essence rating 2 higher than your current rating (to a maximum of 5) for all purposes. You can learn Essence 3 charms in these abilities right off the bat during character creation, and use upgrades to them sooner than otherwise. When your character's essence is 4, then a charm in one of your Supernal Abilities that lets you make (Essence + 2) attacks allows you to make 5 (your real Essence 4 + 2, to a maximum of 5).

\subsection*{Costs}
\par Most charms have a cost - they require an exertion of motes, willpower, initiative or even health levels. A character must pay the full cost before activating a charm - they cannot spend their initiative below 0, for example.

\begin{tabular}{ll}
  Example & Cost\\
  \hline
  3m, 1wp & 3 motes, 1 willpower\\
  2i & 2 initiative\\
  1hl & 1 bashing health level\\
  2lhl & 2 lethal health levels\\
  1ahl & 1 aggravated health level\\
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{Types and Timing}
\par Charms come in one of four types, which explain when and how they can be activated.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Permanent: A permanent Charm is just that - a permanent enhancement to the character's prowess, costing nothing to enjoy and providing its benefits passively at all times.
  \item Simple: A simple Charm counts as a combat action in and of itself, and cannot be placed in a flurry. Some take longer, as specified in their text.
  \item Reflexive: Reflexive Charms can be activated either before or after other actions, including between the actions of a flurry or multi-attack charm, but not in the middle of an action. Many of them list specific triggers - a charm may be used only once per triggering event.
  \item Supplemental: Supplemental Charms enhance an action or defense, such as an attack roll, whole craft project, or an attempt to dodge an attack. They are activated during an action - usually while it's being declared, but sometimes latter in the process of resolving it (as specified by the individual charm).
\end{itemize}

\par Any number of supplemental charms may apply to a single roll or defense, but a solar cannot activate the same Charm on the same action multiple times. Supplemental charms may be used to aid actions or defenses even if the character isn't aware of making them - she can use her charms to enhance an Awareness roll to notice danger, or defend herself with Integrity charms even while asleep, unconscious or drugged, for example.

\begin{sidebar}{Conflict}
  \par When they directly affect another character, players (including the Storyteller) must openly declare and charms they're using and their effects. The majority of charms must be used before a dice roll is made (Post-Roll charms are obviously an exception!), and the active character declares first in the case of an opposed action. Below is a detailed breakdown of who can use what when, but don't be intimidated - very seldom do you need to step through all of these out loud.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item A player declares their action and activates any reflexive or supplemental charms related to it.
    \item If the action is against another character, that character's player activates any reflexive or supplemental charms to boost their defense.
    \item The active player rolls, and activates any Post-Roll charms they wish to use.
    \item The defending player activates any Post-Roll charms.
    \item Resolve the action. An attack might hit (triggering a damage roll, and possibly more post-roll charms related to damage) or miss, or a character might be subject to social influence and have the option to spend wp to resist.
    \item Both players may activate any reflexive charms triggered by the action - to counterattack, regain motes, etc.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{sidebar}

\subsection*{Duration}
\par After their type, non-permanent charms list a duration in parentheses. The charm's effects continue to apply and its mote cost remains committed until it ends (those motes cannot be regained until the charm ends). Long-running charms can be ended reflexively at any time, even while the character is unconscious or asleep.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Instant: Instant charms have their effect - often on a single action or roll - and then they're done.
  \item One Round: The charm lasts until the start of the character's next combat action.
  \item One Scene: The charm lasts until the scene changes (see pg. 184).
  \item Indefinite: The charm remains on as long as the character desires (even while sleeping or unconscious).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Keywords}
\par Some charms list one or more keywords after their duration.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Advantage: A charm with this keyword can only be used against an opponent with less initiative than the Solar.
  \item Attack-action: Using this charm counts as the Solar's attack action for the round. She may not use it if she's already taken one this round (or activated another Attack-action charm).
  \item Counterattack: This charm may not be used in response to attacks created by other charms with the Counterattack keyword, and only one Counterattack charm may be activated for a given trigger. Attacks it creates cannot be Clashed, even with the use of charms.
  \item Form: A character may only have one Form charm active at a time. Ending one form charm to activate another immediately refunds all motes committed to the first form.
  \item Group: Any rolls this charm supplements or creates ignore the penalty for group group social influence.
  \item Iconic: This charm may only be activated when the Exalt's anima is at the Bonfire / Iconic level.
  \item Mute: This charm's cost does not add to the Exalt's anima level unless she wants it to.
  \item Perilous: Charms with this keyword cannot be used in Initiative Crash. If the charm lasts longer than Instant, it ends if the Exalt crashes.
  \item Once/X: A character can only use this once per scene/day/story/season.
  \item Pilot: To activate charms with this keyword, the character must be the helmsman or captain of a vessel. For Sailing related charms without it, "the character's ship" refers to any vessel she's a passenger, crew, or otherwise associated with.
  \item Post-roll: This charm is activated after dice have been rolled, but before success has been determined. For example, a player could wait until she knows how many successes have been rolled on an attack before activating a Post-roll defense.
  \item Psyche: A power with this keyword is an unnatural, hypnotic, or sorcerous power that magically influences, controls, or cripples an opponent's thoughts or feelings.
  \item Quickshot - Attacks granted or enhanced by this Charm do not require an Aim action to succeed, regardless of range.
    This Charm's effects can stack.
\end{itemize}

\end{multicols}
\section*{Limitations and Terminology}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\par A Solar may not add more than (Attribute + Ability) dice to a single roll, and each automatic success counts as two dice. If a combination of charms would add more dice/successes than that, discard the extras.
\par  When charms refer to increasing of decreasing a duration in increments, use the following chart: \\
    Decades --- Years --- Months --- Weeks --- Days --- Hours --- Minutes --- Seconds

\par Charms can modify dice rolls in a variety of ways. Some of these are also mentioned in the glossary, but repeated here for ease of reference. If multiple effects modify a single roll, apply them in this order.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Add X dice: Roll X more dice than you normally would.
    \item X automatic successes: After rolling, add X successes.
  \end{enumerate}

\begin{sidebar}{Multiple Attacks}
If a charm asks the solar to divide her initiative up evenly into some number of attacks, divide as evenly as possible. For example, if she were dividing 8i among three attacks, she'd make attacks with 3i, 3i and 2i.
\par\vspace{6pt} If any effect would cause her to crash in the middle of a multiattack (a counterattack or dodge charms sapping her initiative, for example), she crashes immediately and cannot make any more attacks. After all attacks complete, if she isn't crashed:
\begin{itemize}
  \item If she hit with at least one decisive attack, she resets to base initiative.
  \item If all her decisive attacks missed, she loses initiative as though she'd only missed with one.
\end{itemize}
\par\vspace{6pt} If a charm applies a single attack against multiple opponents, apply the attack to all opponents before anyone activates Reflexive effects based on it.
\begin{itemize}
  \item If she hits at least one opponent with a decisive attack, she resets to base initiative.
  \item If she missed all opponents with a decisive attack, she loses initiative for missing with a single attack.
\end{itemize}
\end{sidebar}

\end{multicols}
\section*{Excellencies}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\par The Chosen enjoy a fundamental power called the Excellencies. When a Solar uses an Excellency, she channels pure Essence into her endeavors - the fundamental power of the sun quickens and strengthens her blows, sharpens her sight, or steadies her hands.

\par Solars may purchase the Excellency for any ability they have a dot in, as they would any other charm with its prerequisite.

\charm{Excellent Solar (Ability)}
{1m per die, or 2m per +1 to static value}
{Supplemental}
{Instant}
{-}
{(Ability) 1}
The Solar adds +(motes spent) dice to an (Ability) roll, or +(motes spent / 2) to a static value derived from (Ability). Remember the “Using Charms and Charm Limitations” section above.

\chapter{Martial Arts}

\begin{multicols}{2}
Creation's martial arts are the stuff of legend, powerful fighting styles that emulate the ferocity of mighty beasts or follow paths of esoteric wisdom. Martial artists come in many forms throughout the world. The vast majority are mortal men and women who've attained extraordinary martial prowess through intense study, discipline, and training. In the hands of the Exalted, the martial arts rise to even greater peaks of power, allowing supernatural martial artists to harmonize themselves fully with the Essence of a style to master its full potential.

\subsection*{Styles}
  There is no singular "Martial Arts" Ability. Instead, there are many of them, each representing a specific discipline. A character never has dots in "Martial Arts", only in specific styles - Snake, Tiger, Dreaming Pearl Courtesan, or many others. Whenever the book refers to Martial Arts, it means all styles - a character that favors Martial Arts gains a discount when purchasing dots and charms of any style, a character with Supernal Martial Arts treats her essence as 5 for the purposes of buying any style's charms, etc.

  Each style is limited in the weapons and armor that can be used with it. A character may only make attacks or parries using a style ability or activate style charms while armed with weapons and wearing armor appropriate to the style (or while unarmed and/or unarmored, as most styles allow style). Artifact weapons and armor are always compatible with styles their mundane equivalents can be used with.

  \par When a character arms or armors herself inappropriately for a style, she ends any active charms from that style.

\subsection*{Mastery and Terrestrial}
  While all beings capable of wielding essence learn the same martial arts charms, not all beings are equally puissant, and some are more able to take advantage of the enlightenment these charms represent.

  Some charms in this chapter have a Mastery or Terrestrial section, denoting that the charm has a greater or lesser effect when used by different Exalts. Solars and Abyssals always receive the Mastery benefit, while Sidereals have their own esoteric methods for accessing these effects. Dragon-Blooded take the lesser effects given in a charm's Terrestrial section, though certain masters of the Immaculate Order have developed initiations to overcome this limitation.

\end{multicols}

\begin{Ability}{Snake Style}

  Snake style is swift and agile, moving with the speed of a striking serpent to fell stronger or better-armed foes before they even have a chance to act. Its strikes emphasize precision over brute strength, and a master of the style can pierce through armor, paralyze an enemy with a pressure-point strike, or even deliver poisonous Essence through her fingertips. It flourishes in dojos of the South and the East, where students learn to emulate the motion and tactics of the native serpents, but as one of the ancient animal styles whose lineage dates back to the First Age, its practitioners can be found throughout all of Creation.

  \subsection*{Weapons and Armor}
  Snake style may be practiced unarmored or in light armor. Its unarmed attacks are usually two-fingered fang attacks that stab at pressure points and exposed tendons. It can also be used armed with a seven-section staff or hooked sword, which are wielded with extraordinary speed and finesse.

  \input{MAcharms/Snake}

\end{Ability}
\begin{Ability}{Tiger Style}

  \par Tiger style emulates the ferocious strength and swift, pouncing strikes of the predatory cats. A Tiger stylist treat combat as a dance between predator and prey, pursuing her foe with unmatched speed and unrelenting patience. Once she closes in on her victim, she brings him down like a tiger fells its prey - knocking him to the ground, crippling his limbs, and moving in for the killing strike. Many who follow the path of Tiger style become arrogant, impatient, or cruel, as their trust in their killing power becomes absolute. Others learn different lessons, adapting the patient bearing of a cat stalking its prey through the jungle.

  \subsection*{Weapons and Armor}
  Tiger style uses unarmed attacks - generally raking claws strikes - or tiger claws to slash the flesh of enemies. The style is compatible with light armor.

  \input{MAcharms/Tiger}

\end{Ability}

\begin{Ability}{Dreaming Pearl Courtesan}

  \par Dreaming Pearl Courtesan is a subtle style - graceful, elusive, and lethal. A student learns to maneuver herself into the perfect position to strike, gaining the confidence and trust of her victims as she navigates the veils of defenses they put up between themselves and the world. Once the Dreaming Pearl Courtesan has reached her victim at his most vulnerable - whether that is in the tangle of his boudoir's sheets, a friendly conversation in a tearoom, or a secret meeting at court—she reveals her true nature as a killer, fighting with a deadly grace and the elusiveness of a dream.

  \subsection*{Weapons and Armor}
  Dreaming Pearl Courtesan style must be practiced unarmored. It may be used unarmed or with war fans, whips and elegant improvised weapons, such as weighted sleeves, scarves, hairpins and hand mirrors. When used with the style, the Storyteller should grant them tags as appropriate to their nature.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Disarming: The Disarming tag applies to garments or accessories that can be used to leverage weapons out of their wielder's grip, such as sashes or sleeves. These weapons usually also have the Bashing and Flexible tags.
    \item Grappling: The Grappling tag applies to accessories and garments that could conceivably be used to entangle or tie up an enemy such as the sash of a kimono, a long scarf, a ball gown train, a blanket or sheet, or a length of silken rope. These weapons usually also have the Bashing and Flexible tags.
    \item Piercing: The Piercing tag applies to accessories that are small or sharp enough to slip through the defenses of armor, such as hairpins, cutlery, knitting needles, or elegantly decorated false nails. These weapons usually also have the Lethal tag.
    \item Shield: The Shield tag applies to accessories and garments that seem well-suited to fending off attacks with their broad surface, such as paper fans, hand mirrors, or the long sleeves of a robe. These weapons usually also have the Bashing tag.
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{sidebar}{...What?}
    Invoking the Chimera's Coils, the last charm in this style, is rather strange. Monstrous transformations, divine auras, the potential threat of unwanted enlightenment - this type of thing is the high-water mark for how strange martial arts can get. Other styles might feature powerful capstones that reach similar levels of esoteric effects and bizarre powers, but those are exceptions rather than the norm. Storyellers who find it too weird of an ending to an otherwise sensible Martial Art may wish to allow players (or their NPCs) to purchase the alternate version of the charm instead.

  \begin{multicols}{2}
  Across Creation, sorcerers are known and feared as figures of great and dangerous power, said to be capable of slaying a man with a gesture or calling up storms with a glance. The magic of sorcery is fundamentally different from Solar Charms. A Solar Charm is an expression of the Solar's own Essence through supreme mastery of skill. Sorcery is the art of shaping the Essence of the world itself, willing
  it into accordance with the sorcerer’s whims. To work sorcery is to command essential forces, consort with strange spirits, and call up impossible wonders.

  \section{Spells and Sorcerous Workings}
  The powers of sorcery are divided into spells and sorcerous workings. A spell is a discrete power with a defined cost and effects. Sorcerous workings, on the other hand, are

Training an animal to unlock its latent abilities requires a minimum of Survival 3 and a specialty in animal husbandry. The trainer makes an extended roll with an interval of one month and a goal of 10, with a difficulty determined by the animal’s attitude - docile and tamed beasts would be difficulty 1, a wild wolf would be difficulty 2, while a tyrant lizard would be difficulty 5. Training a familiars provides a number of bonus dice equal to the trainer’s Intimacy to the animal. The trainer must spend the entire month interacting with the beast, teaching it words, signals, commands, and running it through exercises daily. Any significant amount of time the trainer spends away from the beast during this time

  \section{The Magical Materials}
  \begin{multicols}{2}
  The five magical materials are the most mystically potent substances known to the craftsmen and savants of Creation, and they almost universally form the basis for artifact creation. The dominant magical material used in an artifact has an enormous impact not only on its character, but on who most strongly covets the item - all Exalted have powerful affinities for a particular magical material, and limited aptitude in establishing a bond with artifacts not of that substance. This has no mechanical impact, but Solars will often feel uncomfortable atuning to Soulsteel artifacts, and Dragon Blooded nervous and overawed by a connection to orichalcum. Some powerful artifacts incorporate multiple magical materials into different parts of its substance.

  \subsection*{Jade}
  Jade is the most common of the magical materials, found in quarries and deposits all across Creation. It resonates with the Dragon-Blooded, and is used not only to forge their artifacts, but as the true currency of the Realm. Jade is the most diverse magical material, appearing in five varieties - while all Dragon-Blooded are equally adept with any variety of jade, most prefer to adorn themselves with jade matching their inborn Aspect. Jade is by far the most common magical material used in composite artifacts.

  \subsection*{Moonsilver}
  Moonsilver is a silvery metal, harder than steel in its unworked state, with a liquid, quicksilver sheen when viewed in dim light. It resonates with the Lunar Exalted, and in the past, Luna’s Chosen felt that for any non-Lunar to carry moonsilver arms and armor burdened them with proving themselves worthy of the substance - it was common for Lunars to challenge the bearers of moonsilver to contests and competitions. In the modern day, the Lunars are prone to simply stealing or seizing any moonsilver artifacts they become aware of, making such wonders dangerous to own.

  \subsection*{Orichalcum}
  Orichalcum is a super-hard, bright, golden metal to which the Solar Exalted feel a natural affinity. The Solars much valued orichalcum, for it resonated with their own Charms far more strongly than any other substance. Orichalcum can sometimes be found in naturally-occurring veins, often on mountains, plateaus, and other elevated locales. In the First Age, a process was known that could refine gold into orichalcum by using lava and mystical mirrors to concentrate the light of the sun, but those refineries were destroyed or abandoned during the Usurpation and the centuries of collapse that followed.

  \subsection*{Starmetal}
  Starmetal, once refined and worked, is the least ostentatious of the magical materials - it looks like top-quality steel, with an unusually reflective and polished surface. When light strikes starmetal just so, it gleams in the prismatic colors of the Five Maidens. Starmetal is the rarest magical material, refined from the ore found in fallen stars. The Sidereal Exalted find starmetal alone resonates with their Essence, and use their astrology and sorcery to predict and chart the course of falling stars, then venture out into Creation to recover the meteoric ore. Due to its extreme rarity, most starmetal artifacts sport delicate and minimalist designs, and when starmetal appears in composite artifacts, it is usually in the form of wire filigree or etched designs rather than amalgamated alloy.

  \subsection*{Soulsteel}
  Soulsteel is a gruesome magical material, appearing at first glance like black steel. When light strikes it, however, tortured faces can sometimes be glimpsed deep in the metal, and under extended scrutiny, they can be seen (and in the heat of battle, occasionally heard) to writhe and scream. Alone among the magical materials, soulsteel cannot be found in naturally-occurring deposits in Creation, but is instead made in the soul-forges of the Deathlords, pounded together from rare Underworld ores and the souls of those who have angered the lords of the realm of tears and dust. The Abyssal Exalted find that soulsteel resonates with their nature, and are rarely seen in Creation without it. Soulsteel artifacts dating back to the First Age are exceedingly rare, but not unknown.
