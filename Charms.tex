\chapter{Charms}
\begin{multicols}{2}

The Exalted are mighty. Some break swords upon their skin or shatter stone with their fists while others sing songs that move the rocks themselves to tears. As they grow into the fullness of their power, they may form new reality out of primordial chaos, single handedly rout armies or step through shadows and minds in search of secrets

\par These powers and more are represented as Charms, tidy little packages of name, flavor and mechanical effect the game wraps around your character's supernatural prowess. This abstraction is just that - an abstraction. Simply put, we talk about Charms as power and magic and techniques, but when a player has her character use Monkey Leap Technique, the Solar leaps high enough to clear a rooftop - but the character is simply applying their skill at athletics. Charms aren't magic spells. Those who behold a Solar throwing aside a boulder would remark on her incredible strength, but not her use of Increasing Strength Exercise or Thunder's Might.

\end{multicols}
\section{Reading charms}
\begin{multicols}{2}

\subsection*{Minimums}
\par Solar charms all require a minimum level of skill in their associated ability, and many of them expand on earlier charms in that ability. A character must meet all of a charm's Prereqs before she can learn it. Some charms offer also repurchases - by buying a charm additional times, a character can unlock further power.

\par A Solar treats her Essence as 5 for charms in her Supernal Ability for the purposes of prerequistes, upgrades and accessing repurchases, but not for calculating numeric effects (such as range or number of successes added).

\subsection*{Costs}
\par Most charms have a cost - they require an exertion of motes, willpower, initiative or even health levels. A character must pay the full cost before activating a charm - they cannot spend their initiative below 0, for example, or spend levels of anima generated by paying the mote cost of a charm.

\begin{tabular}{ll}
  Example & Cost\\
  \hline
  3m, 1wp & 3 motes, 1 willpower\\
  2i & 2 initiative\\
  3a & 3 anima levels\\
  1hl & 1 bashing health level\\
  2lhl & 2 lethal health levels\\
  1ahl & 1 aggravated health level\\
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{Types and Timing}
\par Charms come in one of four types, which explain when and how they can be activated.

\begin{itemize}
\item Permanent: A permanent Charm is just that - a permanent enhancement to the character's prowess, costing nothing to enjoy and providing its benefits passively at all times.
\item Simple: A simple Charm counts as a combat action in and of itself, and cannot be placed in a flurry. Some take longer, as specified in their text.
\item Reflexive: Reflexive Charms can be activated either before or after other actions, including between the actions of a flurry or multi-attack charm, but not in the middle of an action. Many of them list specific triggers - a charm may be used only once per triggering event.
\item Supplemental: Supplemental Charms enhance an action or defense, such as an attack roll, whole craft project, or an attempt to dodge an attack. They are activated during an action - usually while it's being declared, but sometimes latter in the process of resolving it (as specified by the individual charm).
\end{itemize}

\par Any number of supplemental charms may apply to a single roll or defense, but a solar cannot activate the same Charm on the same action multiple times. Supplemental charms may be used to aid actions or defenses even if the character isn't aware of making them - she can use her charms to enhance an Awareness roll to notice danger, or defend herself with Integrity charms even while asleep, unconscious or drugged, for example.

\begin{sidebar}{Conflict}\
  \par When they directly affect another character, players (including the Storyteller) must openly declare and charms they're using and their effects. The majority of charms must be used before a dice roll is made (Post-Roll charms are obviously an exception!), and the active character declares first in the case of an opposed action. Below is a detailed breakdown of who can use what when, but don't be intimidated - very seldom do you need to step through all of these out loud.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item A player declares their action and activates any reflexive or supplemental charms related to it.
    \item If the action is against another character, that character's player activates any reflexive or supplemental charms to boost their defense.
    \item The active player rolls, and activates any Post-Roll charms they wish to use.
    \item The defending player activates any Post-Roll charms.
    \item Resolve the action. An attack might hit (triggering a damage roll, and possibly more post-roll charms related to damage) or miss, or a character might be subject to social influence and have the option to spend wp to resist.
    \item Both players may activate any reflexive charms triggered by the action - to counterattack, regain motes, etc.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{sidebar}

\subsection*{Duration}
\par After their type, non-permanent charms list a duration in parentheses. The charm's effects continue to apply and its mote cost remains committed until it ends (those motes cannot be regained until the charm ends). Long-running charms can be ended reflexively at any time, even while the character is unconscious or asleep.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Instant: Instant charms have their effect - often on a single action or roll - and then they're done.
  \item One Round: The charm lasts until the start of the character's next combat action.
  \item One Scene: The charm lasts until the scene changes (see pg. 184).
  \item Indefinite: The charm remains on as long as the character desires (even while sleeping or unconscious).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Keywords}
\par Some charms list one or more keywords after their duration.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Advantage: A charm with this keyword can only be used against an opponent with less initiative than the Solar.
  \item Attack-action: Using this charm counts as the Solar's attack action for the round. She may not use it if she's already taken one this round (or activated another Attack-action charm).
  \item Counterattack: This charm may not be used in response to attacks created by other charms with the Counterattack keyword, and only one Counterattack charm may be activated for a given trigger. Attacks it creates cannot be Clashed, even with the use of charms.
  \item Form: A character may only have one Form charm active at a time. Ending one form charm to activate another immediately refunds all motes committed to the first form.
  \item Group: Any rolls this charm supplements or creates ignore the penalty for group group social influence.
  \item Mute: This charm's cost does not add to the Exalt's anima level unless she wants it to.
  \item Perilous: Charms with this keyword cannot be used in Initiative Crash. If the charm lasts longer than Instant, it ends if the Exalt crashes.
  \item Once/X: A character can only use this once per scene/day/story/season.
  \item Pilot: To activate charms with this keyword, the character must be the helmsman or captain of a vessel. For Sailing related charms without it, "the character's ship" refers to any vessel she's a passenger, crew, or otherwise associated with.
  \item Post-roll: This charm is activated after dice have been rolled, but before success has been determined. For example, a player could wait until she knows how many successes have been rolled on an attack before activating a Post-roll defense.
  \item Psyche: A power with this keyword is an unnatural, hypnotic, or sorcerous power that magically influences, controls, or cripples an opponent's thoughts or feelings.
  \item Quickshot - Attacks granted or enhanced by this Charm do not require an Aim action to succeed, regardless of range.
    This Charm's effects can stack.
\end{itemize}

\end{multicols}
\section*{Limitations and Terminology}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\par A Solar may not add more than (Attribute + Ability) dice to a single roll, and each automatic success counts as two dice. If a combination of charms would add more dice/successes than that, discard the extras.
\par Some charms grant the character a "full excellency." This is shorthand for "add (Attribute + Ability) dice to the roll".

\par  When charms refer to increasing of decreasing a duration in increments, use the following chart: \\
    Decades --- Years --- Months --- Weeks --- Days --- Hours --- Minutes --- Seconds

\par Charms can modify dice rolls in a variety of ways. Some of these are also mentioned in the glossary, but repeated here for ease of reference. If multiple effects modify a single roll, apply them in this order.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Add X dice: Roll X more dice than you normally would.
    \item Exploding Xs: For each die that comes up, X, roll an additional die (these dice don't count against the normal dice adding cap explained above).
    \item Disappearing Xs: When any die come up X, reroll it (this isn't limited by the normal dice adding cap explained above).
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Repeat Exploding/Disappearing steps until no more of any disappearing numbers remain and all Exploding numbers have added additional dice.\
    \end{itemize}
    \item Double X+s: A result of X or greater on any rolled die is counted as two successes rather than one. Most rolls benefit from Double 10s, except for Decisive damage rolls. Multiple Doubles are redundant - a roll with Double 8+s already gets two successes for roll a 9, so Double 9+s adds nothing more.
    \item Penalized Xs: A result of X counts a -1 success. If this reduces the roll to 0 or fewer successes, it's a botch. Multiple Penalized Xs don't stack - a number that counts as -1 for multiple reasons still only counts as -1.
    \item X automatic successes: After rolling, add X successes.
  \end{enumerate}

\begin{sidebar}{Multiple Attacks}
If a charm asks the solar to divide her initiative up evenly into some number of attacks, divide as evenly as possible. For example, if she were dividing 8i among three attacks, she'd make attacks with 3i, 3i and 2i.
\par\vspace{6pt} If any effect would cause her to crash in the middle of a multiattack (a counterattack or dodge charms sapping her initiative, for example), she crashes immediately and cannot make any more attacks. After all attacks complete, if she isn't crashed:
\begin{itemize}
  \item If she hit with at least one decisive attack, she resets to base initiative.
  \item If all her decisive attacks missed, she loses initiative as though she'd only missed with one.
\end{itemize}
\par\vspace{6pt} If a charm applies a single attack against multiple opponents, apply the attack to all opponents before anyone activates Reflexive effects based on it.
\begin{itemize}
  \item If she hits at least one opponent with a decisive attack, she resets to base initiative.
  \item If she missed all opponents with a decisive attack, she loses initiative for missing with a single attack.
\end{itemize}
\end{sidebar}

\end{multicols}
\section*{Excellencies}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\par The Chosen enjoy a fundamental power called the Excellencies. When a Solar uses an Excellency, she channels pure Essence into her endeavors - the fundamental power of the sun quickens and strengthens her blows, sharpens her sight, or steadies her hands.

\par Solars automatically gain an Excellency for each Caste and Favored Ability in which they possess at least one dot, as well as any Ability for which they have learned at least one Charm.

\charm{Excellent Solar (Ability)}
{1m per die, or 2m per +1 to static value}
{Supplemental}
{Instant}
{-}
{(Ability) 1}
The Solar adds +(motes spent) dice to an (Ability) roll, or +(motes spent / 2) to a static value derived from (Ability). Remember “Using Charms and Charm Limitations” above.
\end{multicols}

\begin{Ability}{Archery}

  \charm{Wise Arrow}
  {1m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Archery 2}
  This Charm supplements any Archery attack, giving the target a -1 penalty on their defense.

  In addition, after taking an aim action, the Solar may activate this Charm to strike an opponent in full cover. So long as there is some opening or path where an arrow can get through, arcing or ricocheting, Wise Arrow treats a character in full cover as if he merely has +3 Defense.

  \charm{Sight Without Eyes}
  {1m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Archery 3, Wise Arrow}
  This charm supplements an Archery attack, allowing the Exalt ignores all penalties for visual conditions. Smoke, fog, and pitch darkness don't hinder her, though other factors such as high winds and cover still apply against the attack.

  At Archery 5+, Essence 3+, she can momentarily see through cover, perceiving her targets as silhouettes the colors of bright anima.

  \charm{Blood Without Balance}
  {3m}
  {Reflexive}{Instant}{Quickshot}
  {Archery 4, Sight Without Eyes}
  Upon becoming the beneficiary of a distract gambit, if the Solar's new Initiative would allow her to act immediately she may use this Charm to make a decisive Archery attack. Increase the raw damage of the attack to 6 if she has less than 6i.

  \charm{Force Without Fire}
  {3m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Archery 4, Sight Without Eyes}
  This charm supplements a withering Archery attack from short or close range. If the attack does at least as much damage as her target's Stamina, that Initiative is lost rather than transferred to the Solar, and the target is knocked down and back an entire range band.

  \charm{Trance of Unhesitating Speed}
  {4m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Instant}{Quickshot, Perilous}
  {Archery 3, Wise Arrow}
  The Exalt makes up to (Lower of Dexterity or Initiative / 3) decisive Archery attacks, dividing her initiative evenly between them. Each 10 she rolls on an attack increases the base damage of that attack by one.

  \charm{Phantom Arrow Technique}
  {1m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Archery 3}
  This charm supplements an Archery attack, allowing the Exalt to shoot without ammunition.

  Once/Scene - She may suffuse at attack with one of her Intimacies. Doing so gives her attack double 9s if she uses a Minor or Major intimacy, or double 8s for a defining one, but also temporarily numbs her to that Intimacy. Treat it as though it does not exist for the purposes of social influence. This ability can be reset by spending significant effort in restoring or remembering the Intimacy.

  At Essence 3+, an arrow so infused cannot be destroyed or pulled from the target as long as she lives. A tree can still be cut down, a wall still reduced to rubble - but the arrow will remain inviolate. Only the Solar who fired this arrow, or one blessed with her permission, may remove it from its resting place.

  \charm{Fiery Arrow Attack}
  {2m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Archery 4, Phantom Arrow Technique}
  This charm supplements a Decisive Archery attack, adding one automatic success to the damage roll. If the arrow strikes flammable materials, a violent blaze instantly springs up. If the attack does at least three health levels of damage, the target catches on fire, and must contend with (Solar's Essence) lethal dice of damage every turn until he's able to extinguish himself.

  With an Essence 2+ repurchase, the Exalt can spend an additional 3m. If she does for each 10 in the attack roll she adds one die to the attack's raw damage. The arrow goes off like a spectacular flare that can be seen for miles. Every target using shadows for cover within two range bands must roll Stealth with a -2 success penalty or be revealed.

  \charm{There Is No Wind}
  {3m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Archery 5, Essence 2, Sight Without Eyes}
  This charm supplements an Archery attack, allowing it to be made from up to extreme range. The Solar also ignores penalties from non-visual conditions such as high winds, bad weather, flawed ammunition, and so on (but not cover).

  If the attack is withering, her accuracy is calculated as if it were made from short range regardless of the distance she's firing from.

  \charm{Accuracy Without Distance}
  {1m, 1wp}
  {Reflexive}{Instant}{-}
  {Archery 5, Essence 2, Force Without Fire}
  When making a decisive Archery attack, the Solar may activate this charm to make an aim action instantly, and convert the subsequent three bonus dice into automatic successes.

  With an Essence 5 repurchase she can Once/Scene use this with a withering Archery attack against a crashed opponent. If the attack fails to meet the DV of the opponent, treat it as still having hit with 0 threshold successes.

  \charm{Arrow Storm Technique}
  {5m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Archery 5, Essence 2, Trance of Unhesitating Speed}
  This charm supplements a Decisive Archery attack. In addition to its initial target, it strikes up to (Essence * 3) targets up to medium range from the initial one using the same attack roll, but dividing her initiative evenly among all attacks. Each one then gains (Perception) raw damage.

  \charm{Flashing Vengeance Draw}
  {3m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Archery 5, Essence 2, Trance of Unhesitating Speed}
  This charm supplements a Join Battle roll, granting (Essence) automatic successes. If she acts before her target in the first round, she may draw her bow reflexively and her first Archery attack that round is unblockable.

  \charm{Hunter's Swift Answer}
  {5m, 1wp}
  {Reflexive}{Instant}{-}
  {Archery 5, Essence 2, Flashing Vengeance Draw}
  When the Solar succeeds at a disengage action, she may immediately activate this charm to make a withering or decisive Archery attack at the person she disengaged from, calculated as though she were still at close range.

  \charm{Immaculate Golden Bow}
  {5m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{One Scene}{-}
  {Archery 4, Essence 2, Phantom Arrow Technique}
  The Exalt creates a weapon from her anima with stats identical to a powerbow or other artifact Archery weapon. It glows like a torch. Players may add custom Evocations to Immaculate Golden Bow as they would another artifact weapon, working with their Storyteller to create Evocations that fit the character's personality or iconic anima manifestation.

  \charm{Revolving Bow Discipline}
  {6m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Instant}{Perilous}
  {Archery 5, Essence 3, Arrow Storm Technique}
  The Solar makes a withering Archery attack against a single uncrashed target within short or close range. If it hits she may make another, repeating until she either misses or crashes her opponent (or it loses a point of magnitude if it's a Battle Group).

  At Essence 4+, the Solar gains one point of temporary Willpower when she crashes a foe with this attack.

  \charm{Finishing Snipe}
  {7m}
  {Reflexive}{Instant}{-}
  {Archery 5, Essence 3, Hunter's Swift Answer}
  The Lawgiver may activate this charm when an opponent within long range crashes, if she has not already used a Simple charm this round. She makes an immediate decisive Archery attack against that target.

  \charm{Shadow-Seeking Arrow}
  {3m, 2i}
  {Reflexive}{Instant}{Quickshot}
  {Archery 5, Essence 3, Fiery Arrow Attack}
  During combat, if the Lawgiver's Awareness check uncovers an opponent, she may immediately make a withering or decisive Archery attack against that opponent. She may pay to use this Charm against each opponent, if she uncovers more than one with a single Awareness check.

  \charm{Searing Sunfire Interdiction}
  {4m, 1i, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Instant}{Quickshot}
  {Archery 5, Essence 3, Fiery Arrow Attack}
  If the Exalt aims before using the Charm, she may act first on the next round, regardless of her place in the Initiative order. She makes a difficulty 3 Archery gambit against a target, with double 9s on the Initiative roll if it hits. If successful, it blasts the target out of position, forcing him to act (2 + threshold successes on the gambit's Initiative roll) ticks later than he would have. If Searing Sunfire Interdiction drops the target to a tick of 0 or less, he loses his turn for the round. Searing Sunfire Interdiction cannot be used on the same target two rounds in a row.

  An Essence 3+ repurchase of this Charm lowers the difficulty of the gambit to 2, and she gains 3i if the gambit succeeds.

  An Essence 5+ repurchase allows the Solar to use Searing Sunfire Interdiction two rounds in a row on the same target, dropping the Willpower cost from the second shot. If the gambit succeeds both times, he's also forced backwards a range band.

  \charm{Rain of Feathered Death}
  {3m per duplicate, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Instant}{-}
  {Archery 5, Essence 3, Phantom Arrow Technique}
  The solar makes a single decisive Archery attack, which splits into up to (Dexterity) arrows all directed against the same target. If the attack hits, each created arrow hits with a raw damage equal to the Solar's current Initiative minus her successes on the previous damage rolls, to a minimum of (Essence) damage. For example, if she rolls 10 damage dice and gains two successes on the first roll, the second roll will feature eight damage dice. If that gains four successes, her third damage roll will be four dice.

  \charm{Solar Spike}
  {5m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Instant}{Quickshot, Advantage, Once/Scene}
  {Archery 5, Essence 3, Fiery Arrow Attack x2}
  The Lawgiver draws a blazing bolt of Essence across her bow and makes a decisive Archery attack, which ignores the maximum range of her weapon if this charm was preceded by an Aim action. This attack may not be supplemented with Fiery Arrow Attack. If it hits, the Spike has a raw damage equal to her current temporary Willpower plus the rating of any Intimacy she is trying to uphold or protect. Her Initiative does not reset to base.

  Solar Spike can be reset by landing a withering attack with four 10s rolled on the attack roll.

  A repurchase allows the Solar to spend an additional 3m, 3a to add her Initiative to the base damage of the attack. If she does, her Initiative will reset to base as normal if the attack hits. Should this attack slay the target, their body is engulfed in a torrent of flames and burned away completely, restoring a number of motes to the Solar equal to her Intimacy rating used in the attack plus the target's permanent Essence score.

  \charm{Heavens Crash Down}
  {6m, 2i, 1wp}
  {Reflexive}{Instant}{-}
  {Archery 5, Essence 4, Revolving Bow Discipline}
  This charm may be used when the Solar is in her -4 health levels and targeted by a withering attack from short or close range. She Clashes the attack using Archery, with (Essence) automatic successes. If she wins the clash, she gains doubles 9s on the damage roll, and Initiative she would gain is instead rolled as dice of decisive damage against her target, ignoring hardness and doubling 10s.

  An Essence 5+ repurchase of this Charm allows the Solar to spend Initiative she doesn't have, going into (or deeper into) the negative.

  \charm{Streaming Arrow Stance}
  {6m}
  {Simple}{One Scene}{Quickshot}
  {Archery 5, Essence 4, Finishing Snipe}
  The Lawgiver does not need to take Aim actions for Archery attacks on crashed targets, regardless of distance.

  \charm{Whispered Prayer of Judgment}
  {1m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Archery 5, Essence 5, Streaming Arrow Stance}
  This charm supplements an Archery attack after an aim action, adding (Essence) damage.

\end{Ability}

\begin{Ability}{Athletics}

  \charm{Graceful Crane Stance}
  {3m}
  {Reflexive}{One Scene}{-}
  {Athletics 1}
  The Exalt has perfect balance, and can stand or run on things too narrow or weak to support her normally, with no chance of falling or breaking through. She automatically succeeds at the (Dexterity + Athletics) roll for such feats as running on a guy wire, standing on a crumbling parapet, balancing on the tip of a pine tree, and similar.

  \charm{Monkey Leap Technique}
  {2m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Athletics 2}
  This charm supplements a reflexive Move action, allowing the Solar to leap forward or straight up one range band. A Solar using this Charm can easily leap to the top of a twenty foot wall or cross a Nexus street over rooftops without a roll. If the Solar continues to leap each turn the cost is reduced to 1m after the first activation.

  \charm{Foe-Vaulting Method}
  {3i}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Advantage}
  {Athletics 2, Graceful Crane Stance, Monkey Leap Technique}
  This charm supplements an attack at close range with any Ability. She rolls Dexterity + Athletics against her opponent's Evasion, and ff successful, the supplemented attack is a surprise attack. Foe-Vaulting Method can reset by landing a decisive attack and building Initiative back up to 6+.

  \charm{Soaring Crane Leap}
  {2m}
  {Reflexive}{One round}{-}
  {Athletics 3, Monkey Leap Technique}
  When falling, the Exalt may activate this charm to drop only a single range band until her next turn. In order to survive a very long falls without damage, she must use for at least two rounds before touching the ground. The Exalt can also use this Charm to drift long distances through the air as she continues to fall. If she was moving forward when the fall began, she may continue to move in that direction on future rounds, falling downward one range band for each band of forward motion.

  \charm{Lightning Speed}
  {3m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Athletics 3}
  This Charm enhances a rush action or test of speed, giving the roll disappearing 5s and 6s, and one bonus success.

  \charm{Increasing Strength Exercise}
  {3m or 3i per bonus}
  {Simple}{One Scene}{-}
  {Athletics 3}
  For every three motes of Essence or Initiative the Exalt spends, she raises the base damage of her withering and decisive attacks by one and lowers the minimum Strength of all Feats of Strength by one. She also adds that many dice to all Strength-based rolls. She cannot spend more than (Essence * 3) motes or initiative in this way.

  \permanentCharm{Winning Stride Discipline}
  {Athletics 4, Lightning Speed}
  In a Rush action or each interval in a test of speed, if the Solar rolls more successes than her fastest opponent she gains her choice of 2m or 2i.

  \charm{Thunderbolt Attack Prana}
  {4m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Athletics 3, Increasing Strength Exercise, Monkey Leap Technique}
  This charm supplements a decisive non-ranged attack from Short range, allowing her to move to Close before making the attack. Using it replaces her normal reflexive Move action for the round. If the attack hits, damage is doubled after rolling. After striking an aerial opponent, the Exalt may fall one range band without taking damage. Thunderbolt Attack Prana may be used in conjunction with Charms of other Abilities.

  \charm{Feather Foot Style}
  {3m}
  {Supplemental}{Until the Exalt stops running}{Mute}
  {Athletics 3, Graceful Crane Stance}
  This charm supplements a move action, allowing the Exalt to dash over liquid or unstable surfaces as if they were solid and move over surfaces as thin as rice paper without breaking through. She may also move across lava or other dangerous surfaces without getting hurt. As long as she is moving at a quick pace, she need not pay the activation cost again.

  At Athletics 5, Essence 2+, she can pause on unstable surfaces without breaking through, changing the duration of this Charm to “one stunt.” She can walk slowly across the surface of a still pond, pause on the crumbling parapet of a castle to give a speech, and so on. This mode does not protect against hazardous surfaces.

  \charm{Spider Foot Style}
  {3m}
  {Reflexive}{Essence + 1 Turns}{Mute}
  {Athletics 4, Feather Foot Style}
  The Solar can run up walls, stand upside down on horizontal surfaces such as tree branches, bridge bottoms or overhangs, lay flat against a ceiling looking down at her prey, or other similar feats.

  \charm{Racing Hare Method}
  {5m, 1wp}
  {Reflexive}{One Hour}{-}
  {Athletics 4, Essence 2, Lightning Speed}
  The Solar gains double 9s on Rush attempts and tests of speed, and for every 10 rolled the Solar gains 1i. Outside of combat, it allows her to move as fast as a running horse.

  If the Lawgiver renews this technique at the end of an hour, ignore the Willpower cost.

  \charm{Leaping Tiger Attack}
  {4m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Advantage}
  {Athletics 5, Essence 2, Thunderbolt Attack Prana}
  This charm supplements a non-ranged attack, allowing her to immediately move Close from up to medium range. Using it replaces her normal reflexive Move action for the round. If her attack is withering, it doubles damage dice after soak. If decisive, it adds her Essence score to the base damage of the attack.

  Leaping Tiger Attack is incompatible with Thunderbolt Attack Prana and Eagle-Wing Style.

  \charm{Armor-Eating Strike}
  {1m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Athletics 3, Essence 2, Increasing Strength Exercise}
  This Charm supplements a non-ranged decisive attack, reducing the target's hardness by (Strength). Armor-Eating Strike may be used with Charms of other Abilities.

  \charm{Thunder's Might}
  {4m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Athletics 5, Essence 2, Increasing Strength Exercise}
  This Charm supplements a feat of strength, granting disappearing 1s. She may lower the strength minimum by 1 for every +3 she accepts on the difficulty (without limit).

  At Essence 3+, the Solar also gains disappearing 2s.

  \charm{Godspeed Steps}
  {5m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Athletics 5, Essence 3, Racing Hare Method}
  This Charm supplements a rush attempt, allowing the Solar to make it from medium range. If successful, she moves to close range and ignores the flurry penalty for any attack she makes this turn. As normal for rushing, she moves closer the first time her opponent moves away.

  With an Essence 4+ repurchase, she may rush from long or extreme range. If she does so, she does not follow her opponent if they move away.

  \charm{Mountain-Crossing Leap Technique}
  {7m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Until she stops leaping}{-}
  {Athletics 5, Essence 3, Soaring Crane Leap}
  The Exalt makes a leap three or four range bands forward or three straight up. This Charm stays active every turn until the Solar stops leaping across range bands, making it possible for the Exalt to cross a mountain range in minutes.

  This charm may not be activated with opponents at Close range, but as an exception to the normal Simple charm rules, may be flurried with Disengage.

  \charm{Eagle-Wing Style}
  {5m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Indefinite}{-}
  {Athletics 5, Essence 3, Mountain-Crossing Leap Technique, Winning Stride Discipline}
  This charm supplements a move action towards an airborn target, allowing the Exalt to soar up to two range bands towards it. On subsequent rounds she must spend 2m or 2i to remain airborn, and all Move actions must be directly towards or away from the target. If she fails to pay the ongoing cost, gets knocked off-course or otherwise begins to fall, Eagle-Wing Style cannot be reactivated until she touches down and is able to leap again.

  If supplementing Mountain-Crossing Leap Technique, ignore the willpower cost.

  A repurchase at Essence 4+ removes the cost to maintain the charm as long as the Solar remains in combat with her aerial target. Her anima typically resolves into wings that resemble an eagle's or something else appropriate.

  \charm{Hurricane Spirit Speed}
  {1i per success}

\begin{Ability}{Awareness}
  \charm{Sensory Acuity Prana}
  {5m}
  {Reflexive}{One Scene}{-}
  {Awareness 2}
  This charm can be activated at any time. The Solar's Awareness rolls have double 8s.

  \permanentCharm{Uncanny Perception Technique}
  {Awareness 2}
  When in the presence of dematerialized spirits, sorcerously-crafted living shadows and other generally invisible or intangible subjects, the Solar experiences strange sensory phenomena appropriate to the nature of the being, such as the sound of bells, the scent of chill winter wind or a coppery taste. She automatically notices the presence of such beings (but not their location) unless they hide from her using Stealth. These sensations are as distinctive as a voice - she'll almost always recognize a spirit or being she's met before.

  \permanentCharm{Surprise Anticipation Method}
  {Awareness 3, Sensory Acuity Prana}
  The Solar takes no penalties to Awareness rolls to notice personal danger from being tired, asleep or unconscious. She wakes with a premonition of danger (though not its source) even if she fails such a roll.

  In addition, for every 10 the Solar rolls on an Awareness check to notice or locate a hidden enemy, trap, or any source of harm not readily apparent, she gains 1m.

  \charm{Keen Sense Technique}
  {5m, 1wp}
  {Reflexive}{Indefinite}{-}
  {Awareness 3, Sensory Acuity Prana}
  When the Solar purchases this charm, choose Sight, Hearing, or Smell, Taste and Touch.

  This charm can be activated at any time. The Solar gains an additional (Perception) dice an any Awareness roll involving the chosen sense (or all three of them).

  With an Essence 2+ repurchase, the Solar gains an additional (Essence) bonus dice.
  With an Essence 3+ repurchase, the bonus applies to all the listed senses. In addition, the Solar takes no penalty to rolls because of being blind or deaf. If both, she only takes -2 on tasks that would normally require those senses.

\begin{sidebar}{What can I do with Awareness?}
  In addition to the obvious use of noticing assassins, a Solar with 5 successes on an Awareness roll might:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Read a letter at a glance from across the room, quickly count masses of troops, see through smoke and fog.
    \item Identify an individual by scent, count the number of individuals in a crowded room, detect poison before taking a bite of food, identify every ingredient in a stew, tell how long ago a specific person left a room.
    \item Listen to conversations through thick stone walls, identify materials by touch, recognize counterfeits, feel an earthquake minutes or hours before it happens.
  \end{itemize}

  With 10 successes, she might:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Spot a field mouse a quarter mile, read a letter at a hundred yards, critique the mating habits of insects.
    \item Smell blood from a mile away, identify which farm food came from by tasting each field in turn
    \item Listen in on a whispered conversation out to long range on a battlefield, read by tracing her fingers over the ink on a page, orient herself to the exit in complete darkness.

  \permanentCharm{Curse-Catching Instinct}
  {Awareness 3, Essence 2, Surprise Anticipation Method}
  Whenever another character lays a curse upon the Solar or meddles with her fate, she rolls (Perception + Awareness), difficulty (meddler's Essence). Success lets the Solar know vaguely what happened (someone is meddling with your fate). With 3 threshold successes she learns a summary of what happened (Sidereal Astrology associated with The Sword is being used to make you more likely to fall ill). With 5 threshold successes she learns what happened in detail (Tekkip Nannaja, Chosen of Endings, is using Astrology associated with The Sword to increase the TN of your disease-resistance rolls to 9 until Calibration).

  \charm{Knowing Beyond Silence}
  {4m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Mute}
  {Awareness 4, Essence 2, Surprise Awareness Method}

  \charm{Genius Palate Summation}
  {2m}
  {Simple}{Instant}{-}
  {Awareness 4, Essence 2, Keen Sense Technique (Smell, Taste and Touch) or Keen Sense Technique x3}
  This Charm acts as an automatically successful read intentions action to determine the emotional state of the one who prepared a meal or poured a drink. The Solar need only sample a single bite of a meal or take a single sip of a drink to gain this understanding.

  \charm{Vigilant Friend Technique}
  {1m}
  {Simple}{Indefinite}{Stackable}
  {Awareness 4, Essence 2, Curse-Catching Instinct}
  The Solar touches a willing character. As long as she keeps the mote committed, she may roll (Perception + Awareness) to notice danger to the character, as though she were standing next to him. Add +1 difficulty if he's more than 1 mile away from her, +2 if more than 10, +3 if more than 100, +4 if he's anywhere on the same plane of existence or +5 if he's not. She doesn't learn the form of the danger, only that it exists, a general sense of the severity, and his location.

  If the character dies, the Solar automatically notices and knows where it happened.

  \charm{Roused Dragon Detection}
  {1m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Awareness 5, Essence 2, Sensory Acuity Prana}
  This charm supplements an attack, allowing the Solar to strike a foe within her weapon's range that she doesn't know the location of. This only reveals the location of her foe if he fails to find a different hiding place on his next turn (if he can do so without changing range bands, this doesn't use up his move action).

  \charm{Foe-Scenting Method}
  {3m}
  {Simple}{Instant}{-}
  {Awareness 5, Essence 2, Keen Sense Technique (Smell, Taste and Touch) or Keen Sense Technique x3}
  The Solar makes a scent-based Read Intentions actions using (Perception + Awareness) to determine a target's disposition, out to medium range without the need to directly interact.

  \charm{Rumour Of The Earth}
  {5m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Instant}{Mute}
  {Awareness 5, Essence 2, Keen Sense Technique (Hearing) or Keen Sense Technique x3}
  The Lawgiver places her head against the ground and listens for five minutes. She can hear any creature larger than a mouse moving within (Essence * 5) miles, and learns their general location, number, and speed and direction of movement. Used in a city or other busy area, the results may not be that useful, but will still indicate any general motion of large numbers of people.

  \charm{Fragility-Creating Examination}
  {5m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Awareness 5, Essence 2, Keen Sense Technique}
  This Charm supplements a feat of strength intended to break something.

  \charm{Vulnerability-Seeking Stare}
  {4m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Awareness 5, Essence 2, Awakening Eye}

  \charm{Guard-Piercing Gaze}
  {4m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Awareness 5, Essence 3, Vulnerability-Seeking Stare}
  This Charm supplements an Aim action. The Solar rolls (Perception + Awareness) against a difficulty of the targeted character's Evasion or Parry. The target may use Charms to increase their Defense as though this were an attack. If she succeeds, the attack enhanced by the Aim action is either undodgeable or unblockable (depending on which Defense they rolled to overcome).

  If used alongside its prerequisite, ignore the wp cost on this charm.

  \charm{Unsurpassed Hearing Discipline}
  {5m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{One conversation}{-}
  {Awareness 5, Essence 3, Keen Sense Technique (Hearing) or Keen Sense Technique x 3}
  The Solar listens in on conversations that happened in her location up to (Essence x 5) hours prior to her arrival as though it were happening right next to her. She must sit still and listen intently for as much of the conversation as she wishes to hear.

  \charm{Vigilant Warrior's Counterstroke}
  {5m}
  {Reflexive}{Instant}{Once/Scene}
  {Awareness 5, Essence 3, Surprise Anticipation Method}

  \charm{Dedicated Unerring Ear}
  {3m}
  {Reflexive}{One exchange}{-}
  {Awareness 5, Essence 4, Unsurpassed Hearing Discipline}
  This charm may be activated any time the Exalt is addressed by someone for whom she holds a Major or Defining Intimacy, no matter how far away he is. So long as she's on the same plane of existence, the Solar can hear the words clearly, as if they were in the same room, so long as they are addressing their speech to her. She can hear everything her compatriot wishes to say to her, until the character has been silent for ten seconds or longer.

  With an Essence 5 repurchase, the charm may also be activated whenever any character uses the Solar's name to refer to her, even if they are not addressing her, without the need for a relevant intimacy. If her name is in common use, the Storyteller should still mostly call attention to interesting and relevant references she might overhear, rather than mundane conversations.

  \charm{Eye of the Unconquered Sun}
  {10m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{One round}{-}
  {Awareness 5, Essence 4, Awakening Eye, Roused Dragon Detection}
  The Solar's caste mark blazes like a tiny sun, cancelling any Essence-muting magic the Solar may be using and removing her from stealth. She applies a single Perception + Awareness roll with (Essence) bonus dice and disappearing 1s against every character's Evasion out to long range. Even solid walls are no protection. Any character who didn't dodge is subject to the following effects.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item They automatically know they've been spotted, and by who.
    \item All magical and mundane Stealth effects are canceled, and she becomes aware of their presence.
    \item Fog lifts, smoke parts, and clouds dissolve.
    \item Dematerialized spirits are forced to materialize, paying full cost of the Materialize Charm or as much of it as they can pay.
    \item All disguise magic is stripped. Mundane disguises tatter and melt away, shapeshifters natural form becomes obvious to all viewers, resplendent destinies are temporarily forced into dormancy, personas are suppressed, and other transformative magic is similarly deactivated or the true form of their user revealed.
    \item This charm cannot contest Perfect effects, such as the Night caste anima power. The Solar learns that she's run up against such an effect, but can't break it.
  \end{itemize}

  If Keen Sense Technique is active, this Charm extends to extreme range.

  {Brawl 1}
  This Charm supplements a bare-handed Brawl parry or attack. The Exalt may parry lethal damage, or deal lethal damage on a decisive attack.

  On a withering attack, she ignores (Essence + strength of a relevant Intimacy) soak. A relevant Intimacy might be a Tie (as the Solar strikes a hated enemy or defends a beloved friend) or a Principle (as the Solar exults in the thrill of violence, for example).

  \charm{Iron Battle Focus}

  \charm{Heaven Thunder Hammer}
  {7m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Brawl 3, Ferocious Jab}
  This charm supplements a decisive Brawl damage roll. Her target is knocked prone by the force of the blow, and loses a point of Initiative. She gains 1i after her Initiative resets. If the damage roll scored at least two successes, the opponent is hurled into an object or surface within close range, hitting it with an impact equivalent to falling a short distance, destroying wooden furniture or the like he collides with.

  At four or more successes, the foe either hits something at close range, suffering damage as though falling from a medium height, or knocked back to short range, suffering falling damage as though from a short distance.

  At Essence 3+, double the successes for determining effects of this charm.

  Moving a Tyrant lizard or other such massive target requires an appropriate feat of strength.

  \charm{Vicious Lunge}

  {5m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Brawl 4, Vicious Lunge}
  This charm supplements a Throw. The damage pool is boosted by +2 damage per round of control forfeited by the throw, and the Exalt can throw her opponent up to short range. If she used Dragon Coil Technique to establish control, she may be able to hurl truly massive opponents at the Storyteller's discretion.

  At Essence 3+, the Exalt may expend two or four rounds of control, decreasing the throw's damage, to throw a foe to medium or long range, forcing him to contend with short or medium distance falling damage (in addition to whatever he might land on).

  \charm{Thunderclap Rush Attack}
  {3m}
  {Reflexive}{Instant}{Attack-action, Once/Scene}
  {Brawl 3}
  This charm may be activated any time a foe is at short range from the Solar. She immediately moves a single range band and makes a Brawl attack. The target cannot defend against the Solar's attack with a Clash unless he uses a Charm which grants him one.

  At Brawl 5, Essence 3+, the character may add 1wp to the cost of this Charm to automatically strip (Essence) Initiative from her target and gain it herself before the attack is made.

  {1m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Brawl 4, Thunderclap Rush Attack}

  This charm may be activated after the Solar has taken withering damage from an opponent at close range. She launches an immediate decisive Brawl attack with a base damage of the amount of withering damage she just took. This attack does not reset the Solar to base Initiative.

  At Essence 3+, the Solar may replace the 1i cost with 1wp, allowing her to use it while at 0 or lower initiative.

  \charm{Ox-Stunning Blow}
  {4m, 1i, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Withering}
  {Brawl 3, Essence 2, Fists of Iron Technique}
  This charm supplements a withering Brawl attack. The Solar's blow gains one automatic success on the attack roll, (Essence) bonus dice to damage, and can only be soaked with the target's Stamina. However, she gains no initiative. Instead, roll that many dice, and the target takes a -(1/2 successes rolled) wound penalty until her Onslaught penalty from the Solar clears.

  An Essence 3+ repurchase allows the Solar to gain the Initiative in addition to penalizing her opponent with rolled successes.

  \charm{Fire-Eating Fist}
  {1m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Brawl 5, Essence 3, Force-Rending Strike}
  This Charm supplements a Brawl Clash. Each 1 rolled by the attacker grants the Solar's Clash a bonus success.

  If activated at the same time as Force-Rending Strike, she may use that charm to Clash energy attacks from beyond close range, reducing the cost by 1wp. If she wins such a clash, she does no damage but her fist becomes wreathed in her attacker's Essence, enjoying (opponent's Essence) bonus attack and damage dice on her next attack.

  At Essence 4+, this effect becomes stackable to a limit of (Stamina) stacks. In addition, the Exalt may treat any ranged attack as if they were elemental bolts for this charm.

  {4m}
  {Reflexive}{Instant}{-}
  {Brawl 5, Essence 3, River-Binding Wrath}
  The Solar may use this charm when she's in control of a clinch and is the target of a decisive attack. She clashes the attack using Brawl. If the clash succeeds, rather than doing damage to the attacker, the damage of the opponent's attack is transferred to her captive.

  \charm{Dragon Coil Technique}
  {3m}
  {Supplemental}{Until end of clinch}{-}
  {Brawl 5, Essence 3, Devil-Strangling Attitude}
  The Solar supplements a grapple gambit, granting (Essence) automatic successes to hit. On the control roll, she gains +1 success for each 10 her opponent rolls. In addition, her withering and decisive savaging attacks and slams enjoy (Essence) bonus dice of damage.

  This charm may instead supplement a defense against a grapple. It grants no bonus successes in this use, but if she wins the roll she can take control of the grapple rather than merely escaping.

  Finally, Dragon Coil Technique allows the Solar to grapple characters of prodigious size — tyrant lizards, river dragons, siaka and similarly sized beasts are valid targets for the her grasp.

  \charm{Shockwave Technique}
  {6m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Once/Scene}
  {Brawl 5, Essence 3, Crashing Wave Throw}
  This charm supplements a Throw, allowing the Solar to toss her target out to short range (or further, if combined with Crashing Wave Throw), and grants 2 extra damage dice per round of control forfeited. In addition, she makes a single withering Brawl attack, base damage 7, which applies to every opponent within short range of where her target lands. If the Solar is crashed when she uses this attack, she still damages each foe, but she only gains Initiative from a single target.

  {1m, 1wp}
  {Reflexive}{Instant}{Once/Scene}
  {Brawl 5, Essence 3, Crashing Wave Throw, Heaven Thunder Hammer}
  After launching an opponent with one of the prerequisite Charms, the Solar immediately moves adjacent to her opponent to make an additional attack using any viable Ability, and may draw a weapon to do so. She may choose to cancel the falling damage or damage from impact with scenery to make it a surprise attack.

  Using Lightning Strikes Twice replaces the Exalt's normal movement action. It can be reset by gaining 10+ Initiative in a single tick.

  The Solar rolls (Wits + Brawl) and stores the result. She can end the charm at any time to use this result in place of a Brawl roll, or to boost Parry or Evasion by 1/2 stored successes. At Essence 4+, the roll gains (Essence) automatic successes.

  This may be activated as though it were Reflexive when the Solar beats all of her opponents in a Join Battle roll, or when she knocks an opponent prone.

  \charm{Orichalcum Fists of Battle}
  {3a}
  {Reflexive}{One Scene}{-}
  {Brawl 5, Essence 4, Adamantine Fists of Battle x2}
  This charm may only be used while Adamantine Fists of Battle is active in its scene-long variation. The Solar's fists glow gold-to-white and her Caste Mark shines brightly. Her decisive attacks ignore hardness, and her base Initiative is increased by one. When she is at base Initiative or lower, her decisive damage rolls gain disappearing 1s.

  \charm{Incarnated Fury Attack}
  {10m, 3a, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Instant}{-}
  {Brawl 5, Essence 4, Adamantine Fists of Battle}
  The Solar makes an unblockable, undodgeable withering Brawl attack against a crashed target with double 7s on the damage roll.

  \charm{Raging Wrath Repeated}
  {4m, 1wp}
  {Reflexive}{Instant}{-}
  {Brawl 5, Essence 4, Dragon Coil Technique}
  If the Solar crashes an opponent she is clinching, she may activate this charm to immediately make a withering or decisive Brawl attack and reset all the rounds of control she had at the beginning of the clinch.

  \charm{Rampage-Berserker Attack}
  {7m, 3i, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Instant}{Once/Scene}
  {Brawl 5, Essence 4, Hammer on Iron Technique}
  The Solar makes a Brawl based withering attack, but instead of adding threshold successes for damage, she multiplies her post soak damage by them.

  Rampage-Berserker Attack can be reset if the Solar incapacitates a powerful or impressive opponent.

  \charm{Supremacy of War Meditation}
  {1m, 3a}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Once/Scene}
  {Brawl 5, Essence 4, Inevitable Victory Meditation}

  \charm{Heaven Fury Smite}
  {0m}
  {Reflexive}{Instant}{-}
  {Brawl 5, Essence 5, Rampage-Berserker Attack}
  This charm can be used when the Lawgiver lands a Brawl attack that crashes her target. She immediately launches a decisive attack against the crashed opponent with any viable Ability, and she may draw a weapon to make it.

\end{Ability}

\begin{Ability}{Bureaucracy}
  \charm{Insightful Buyer Technique}
  {3m}
  {Simple}{Instant}{-}
  {Bureaucracy 3}
  The Solar gains a feel for a particular marketplace, however distant, intuiting roughly how much a given object will fetch. The more specific the venue contemplated, the more accurate the forecast - "to the south" will give only vague ideas of how people further south will value a thing, while "the central bazaar of Gem" will give her a sharp understanding. As always, things change - the longer she waits before acting on this information, the less accurate it may be.

  \charm{Consumer-Evaluating Glance}
  {3m}
  {Reflexive}{One scene}{-}
  {Bureaucracy 3}
  This charm may be activated whenever the Solar sees a character considering a bargain with her. The Solar makes a Read Intentions action (without the need for further interaction) with (Essence) automatic successes. If successful, the Lawgiver learns her target's Resources rating, if he intends to accept the current offer or needs further incentive, and can tell if he plans to betray or cheat her. If he does, she gains a +(Essence) bonus to her Resolve against all bargain attempts by that character.

  \charm{Deft Official's Way}
  {5m}
  {Simple}{One scene}{-}
  {Bureaucracy 1}
  The Lawgiver can sense who to talk to in order to produce results, who expects or is amenable to bribes, which functionaries are actually useful or friendly and which are officious tyrants. Whenever she encounters a rule, law or regulation, she immediately understands both the full text and the spirit in which it is actually enforced (or not). She adds (Bureaucracy) bonus dice to all Read Intentions actions related to understanding bureaucratic obstacles or untangling them.

  \charm{Measuring Glance}
  {5m}
  {Simple}{Instant}{-}
  {Bureaucracy 2, Deft Official's Way}
  The Solar makes ([Social or Mental Attribute] + Bureaucracy) Read Intentions actions, spread among any number of individuals, without need for interaction, regarding their most relevant intimacies towards a given organization.

  \charm{All-Seeing Master Procurer}
  {5m}
  {Reflexive}{One scene}{-}
  {Bureaucracy 4, Consumer-Evaluating Glance}
  For the rest of the scene all of the Solar's customers or potential customers gain a Minor Tie of "this merchant is reliable and knowledgeable."

  \charm{Enigmatic Bureau Understanding}
  {2m}
  {Reflexive}{Instant}{-}
  {Bureaucracy 4, Measuring Glance}
  The Exalt may activate this charm when she enters the presence of a member of an organization she has control over or belongs to who has developed or lost an intimacy relating to it since they last met. She knows something has changed, and may make a Read Intentions action with regards to the new intimacy without needing to interact with them. If the intimacy was caused by a curse or blessing, she becomes aware of the general effect and purpose of the magic.

  At Essence 3, if she succeeds on the Read Intentions action, in addition to learning of the intimacy she also gains a general understanding of what caused it - dissatisfaction, a conversation with a stranger, a bribe, etc. This charm can also now be used to detect curses or blessings that don't modify intimacies.

  \charm{Illimitable Master Fence}
  {1m}
  {Simple}{Instant}{-}
  {Bureaucracy 5, All-Seeing Master Procurer}
  By spending an hour observing normal transactions, speaking with merchants and customers, and watching the general course of economic dalliance, the Lawgiver learns the Bureaucracy ratings and specialties of all notable individuals strongly connected to a specific market, possibly including characters whose names she doesn't know and whose faces she has never seen.

  At Essence 3, she will also recognize any of these individuals on sight.

  \charm{Speed the Wheels}
  {8m}
  {Simple}{One task}{-}
  {Bureaucracy 5, Deft Official's Way}
  By speaking with the right individuals and in just the right way, the Solar sets a bureaucracy's wheels in motion at record speed. While this charm doesn't affect material labor (such as building a road or receiving a shipment), the organization, planning, approval, etc of a single task all occur significantly faster. Reduce the time required by two increments.

  \charm{Bureau-Rectifying Method}
  {10m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{One investigation}{-}
  {Bureaucracy 5, Speed the Wheels}
  This charm supplements the Solar's investigation of an organization. While attending or leading inquiries, reviewing records and interviewing involved parties, the Lawgiver adds (Bureaucracy) automatic successes to Investigation and Socialize rolls. In addition, all members of the organization are treated as having a Minor Tie (trusting respect) towards her.

  \charm{Graceful Magistrate's Eye}
  {2m}
  {Reflexive}{Instant}{Once/Scene per Target}
  {Bureaucracy 3, Essence 2, Deft Official's Way}
  This charm may be used any time. The Solar makes a Read Intentions action against any character she can see, without the need for interaction and with double 9s. If successful, she learns whether he supports - or would support - a specific law or organizational rule, and any intimacies that affect said support.

  \charm{Enlightened Ministerial Halo}
  {4m}
  {Simple}{One Week}{-}
  {Bureaucracy 4, Essence 2, Enigmatic Bureau Understanding}
  The Solar spends a day organizing, researching and otherwise participating in the workings of an organization she does not control. She rolls (Mental Attribute + Bureaucracy), difficulty 4. For the remainder of the week, the organization's leader gains (threshold successes) bonus dice on all Bureaucracy, Investigation, Larceny and War rolls related to running the organization.

  \charm{Irresistible Salesman Spirit}
  {3m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Bureaucracy 5, Essence 2, All-Seeing Master Procurer, Insightful Buyer Technique}
  During a high-pressure or tense exchange, this charm supplements a Bargain action with double 7s, pressing against (but not necessarily exceeding) the bounds of politeness.

  \charm{Bureau-Reforming Kata}
  {5m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Instant}{-}
  {Bureaucracy 5, Essence 2;, Bureau-Rectifying Method, Enigmatic Bureau Understanding}
  When the Solar is aware of hostile magic such as Indolent Official Charm, astrological curses or similar affecting an organization she has control over or influence within, she spends a day moving individuals to new positions, hiring, firing and reorganizing and in so doing cleanses the magic. The organization is immune to that specific power for one month.

  With an Essence 3 repurchase she can activate this charm in minutes rather than a full day, and she learns the identity of anyone whose hostile magic she cancels. The organization is immune to the effect for a full season.

  \charm{Indolent Official Charm}
  {5m}
  {Simple}{Indefinite}{-}
  {Bureaucracy 5, Essence 2, Speed the Wheels}
  This charm is the reverse of Speed the Wheels - with a sidelong glance and a word in the right ears, a single bureaucratic task grinds to halt. While this charm doesn't affect material labor (such as building a road or receiving a shipment), the organization, planning, approval, etc. of a single task all takes one increment longer.

  This charm may be active multiple times on a single organization for different projects, but doesn't stack for any given request. It may be used in advance of a request, or speculatively - for example, she could stymie "any police investigation into my business". As long as the motes are committed, such an investigation would take much longer to complete.

  \charm{Subject-Hailing Ideology}
  {5m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Bureaucracy 5, Essence 2, Bureau Rectifying Method}
  This charm supplements any social influence roll. For purposes of this roll, the Solar's target treats a single weakened or abandoned intimacy as though it had its former strength. The intimacy must be related to some official duty or role - marriage, bodyguard, employee, etc.

  \charm{Lawgiver's Smile}
  {4m}
  {Simple}{One Day}{-}
  {Bureaucracy 4, Essence 3, Enlightened Ministerial Halo}
  The Solar spends 15 minutes walking among her subordinates or comrades. Other members of the organization she belongs to or controls who are present in the scene gain a Minor Principle related to joy, optimism or some similar positive emotion related to a particular aspect of the organization, which fades when the charm ends. Employees are unnaturally enthusiastic about their jobs, and any battle groups they form the majority of have +2 dice on rout checks.

  \permanentCharm{Empowered Barter Stance}
  {Bureaucracy 5, Essence 3, Irresistible Salesman Spirit}

  Once per day when the Solar succeeds at a Bargain action she gains 1wp.

  \charm{Soul-Snaring Pitch}
  {5m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Indefinite}{Mute, Psyche}
  {Bureaucracy 5, Essence 3, Irresistible Salesman Spirit}
  The Exalt makes a Persuade action to convince a character that a particular thing is his heart's desire. She rolls (Manipulation + Bureaucracy) with (Essence) automatic successes against the target's Resolve. If successful, a character must spend (Solar's Essence) willpower, or develop a Defining Tie (I must have it) towards an object of the Solar's choice as long as the charm remains active. Resisting Soul-Snaring Pitch makes a character immune to the Charm for one week.

  \charm{Foul Air of Argument Technique}
  {8m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Indefinite}{-}
  {Bureaucracy 5, Essence 3, Indolent Official Charm}
  Pronouncing words of doom about in front of a large number of organizational members, the Lawgiver makes a ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Bureaucracy) roll against the Resolve of each character leading the project she's doomsaying. For each success threshold success the Solar attains against a particular leader, one of their failures on a roll related to the project will become a Botch.

  \charm{Taboo-Inflicting Diatribe}
  {6m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Indefinite}{Stackable, Psyche}
  {Bureaucracy 5, Essence 4, Foul Air of Argument Technique}
  The Solar repeatedly inveighs against a certain action relating to an organization she controls or has major influence within. Members of her organization gain a Major principle against the action unless they spend 1wp. The behaviors must be specific, and related to the organization - she could not inflict "Stealing is wrong," or but she could give members a Principle of “The company coffers are inviolate” or “Embezzlement from clients is a sin.” This charm may be applied any number of times to a single organization (but only once for a specific intimacy). The intimacy fades if this charm ends.

  With an Essence 5 repurchase, at the end of every month in which a person - member or not - interacts with the organization regularly they roll (Willpower). On a failure, they must spend 1wp or gain the intimacy at Minor strength permanently (it doesn't go away when the charm ends, and is in all ways a normal intimacy). As a rule of thumb for the Storyteller, after a season with this charm active half the populace will have the intimacy, and after a few years virtually all of them will. A particularly accepting or hostile population might speed or slow down the spread.

  \charm{Order-Conferring Action}
  {6m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{One Season}{-}
  {Bureaucracy 5, Essence 5, Taboo-Inflicting Diatribe, Subject-Hailing Ideology}
  By spending a day advising an organization (including by proxy), the Solar turns it into a bulwark of Creation. The Wyld cannot penetrate further into territories it controls or operates in (though Fair Folk themselves still might), diseases struggle to cross its borders, and Shadowlands encroach upon it more slowly.
\end{Ability}

\section*{Craft Rules}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{sidebar}{Which set of Craft Rules?}
  This version of the craft system is designed to be small, simple and easy to use. It does not attempt to regulate your play, or insert itself into any part of the game other than actually making things. It does not aim in incentivize certain types of player behavior, only to adjucate what characters are capable of.

  \par \vspace{6pt} If you like the the rules presented in 3e core, all six pages of them, feel free to continue using them, but the charms below are designed with this simpler version in mind.
\end{sidebar}

\par Basic projects are the simplest tasks a craftsman can undertake, such as making a chair, forging basic tools, shoeing a horse, cooking a meal, or fletching an arrow. They are resolved with a single roll. The character works for an amount of time deemed appropriate by the Storyteller, usually ranging from several minutes to several hours, then makes an (Attribute + Craft) roll against a difficulty set by the Storyteller.

  \par Major projects are significant endeavors within a craftsman's trade, anything larger or more complex than a wheelbarrow. They include forging suits of armor, preparing a banquet fit for a prince's table or a god's festival, or sculpting a statue. They are resolved by extended rolls with no fixed terminus, where each roll represents an expenditure of time and materials.

  \par Essence-wielders may also attempt to create Artifacts and Manses, which do have a terminus set by the crafter's available resources. The difficulty, interval and goal number are determined by artifact rating. These intervals assume about four hours of work each day, but cannot be decreased by spending more time working (though a character would work on multiple projects simultaneously if they had nothing else to do).

  \par Repairing a broken artifact is generally as difficult as creating one a dot lower in rating, except that the interval may be significantly shorter depending on how extensive the damage is. Legendary artifacts, which go beyond the five dot scale, use difficulties, intervals and goal numbers chosen by the Storyteller - not all Legendary Artifacts are created equal, but they're all very difficult.

  \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
    Artifact & Diff & Interval & Goal \# \\
  \hline
    \(\bullet\bullet\) & 4 & Two Weeks & 30 \\
    \(\bullet\bullet\bullet\) & 5 & One Month & 45 \\
    Manse & 5 & One Month & 45\\
    \(\bullet\bullet\bullet\bullet\) & 6 & Two Months & 60 \\
    \(\bullet\bullet\bullet\bullet\bullet\) & 7 & One Season & 75 \\
    Greater Manse & 7 & Two Seasons & 75 \\
  \end{tabular}

  \par As an alternate rule - which should be discussed between all the players (including the Storyteller) before the game begins - replace the Interval of artifact creation with time spent playing. This may work better for exceptionally fast-paced games with little downtime between adventures.

  \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
    Artifact & Alternate Story-based Interval \\
  \hline
    \(\bullet\bullet\) & Twice per Session \\
    \(\bullet\bullet\bullet\) & Once per Session \\
    Manse & Once per Session \\
    \(\bullet\bullet\bullet\bullet\) & Twice per Story \\
    \(\bullet\bullet\bullet\bullet\bullet\) & Once per Story \\
    Greater Manse & Once per Story \\
  \end{tabular}

  \par To find the terminus for an Artifact-creation roll, add together the factors for their workshop and their materials. If you're missing either, you can't even start. Then add bonuses for extra time taken, the help of others, complementary abilities, relevant magic, and anything else that seems appropriate.

  Workshop
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 1 rolls for a basic workshop, with all the standard tools. A character using Craftsman Needs No Tools has this level of workshop for most projects. However, manses and extremely large Artifacts may require large numbers of labourers as part of the “workshop”.
    \item 2 rolls for a master's workshop, which contains a high-quality example of every tool a normal craftsman in the field would ever want.
    \item 3 rolls for a supernaturally excellent workshop. These are rare in Creation, but a few Dynasts and gods and other stranger things have them.
  \end{itemize}

  Materials
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 2 rolls for having a bit of magical material.
    \item 3 rolls for having some magical material and a few thematically appropriate wondrous ingredients.
    \item 4 rolls for having plenty of magical materials and at least one genuinely impressive wondrous ingredient.
    \item 5 rolls for having an embarrassing surplus of suitable ingredients.
  \end{itemize}

  Other
  \begin{itemize}
    \item +1 roll for working with a master assistant or a team of competent workers.
    \item +2 rolls for working with supernaturally excellent help.
    \item +1 roll for taking four times as much time as is standard.
    \item +2 rolls for taking twenty times as much time as is standard.
    \item +1 roll for having an Ability related to the Artifact at 5, or at 3 with a relevant specialty.
    \item +1 roll for having a Charm, spell, anima power, or other magical ability that's related to the Artifact.
  \end{itemize}

  \par If you lose access to something that increases your terminus while working on an Artifact, you may either put the project on hold until you replace it or just accept the reduced terminus. If you use up all of your rolls, all is not lost. Ask the ST what you have to do to earn another roll. Chances are it won't be easy.

  \par Craft can also be used to assess crafted items. This is a simple action requiring a (Perception + Craft) roll. With a success the crafter can determine how old an item is, how well it's made, what it's made of, and what condition it's in, and other similar information. A strong success may also allow the crafter to identify the maker if their style is distinctive.

  This charm supplements any Craft roll, granting it exploding 10s.

  \charm{Glorious Solar Chef}
  {4m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{One day}{Once/Day}
  {Craft 2, A specialty in cooking}
  This Charm supplements an attempt to cook something. The Solar makes a (Charisma + Craft) Instill action to create happiness, targeting anyone who eats her food. If it succeeds, and the target is below half their normal maximum willpower, they gain 1wp. With a suitable stunt, the Solar may attempt to instill something other than happiness.

  \charm{Triumph-Forging Eye}
  {1m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Once/Week}

  The Exalt supplements a Craft roll with a full Excellency.

  \charm{Supreme Masterwork Focus}
  {5m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Craft 3, Flawless Handiwork Method}
  This charm supplements a Craft roll with double 8s.

  An Essence 3+ repurchase allows the Solar to spend an additional 2m, 1wp to gain double 7s instead.

  \charm{Perfect Gemcutter's Art}
  {5m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Craft 4, Flawless Handiwork Method, a specialty in gemcutting}
  This Charm supplements an attempt to cut and polish a gem. If the attempt is successful, the gem shines with light from within. The brightness of the glow depends on the value of the gem; a flawed quartz might only glow visibly in the dark, while a large and flawless diamond might be painful to look at. Gems cut this way glow until destroyed, and can easily become famous treasures or precious heirlooms.

  \charm{Flawless Example}
  {5m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Craft 5, Flawless Handiwork Method}
  This charm supplements a non-artifact Craft project. For as long as the result endures, any character with a related Craft specialty who examines it daily adds a success to all rolls to make a similar item. If they're trying to duplicate the item exactly, they add an additional success. A character who uses this bonus repeatedly for a month may purchase a one-dot Merit which duplicates the effects of examining the item daily, though the successes still count as coming from a charm.

  \charm{Craftsman Needs No Tools}
  {4m}
  {Supplemental}{One task}{Mute}
  {Craft 3}
  This charm supplements a Basic project or personal-scale non-magical Major project, allowing the Solar to work on it without tools, using only her hands. Reduce the time required by two increments.

  \charm{Shattering Grasp}
  {6m}
  {Supplemental}{One task}{Mute}
  {Craft 4, Craftsman Needs No Tools}
  This charm supplements a Feat of Strength to destroy or dismantle an object. The Solar compares her (Perception or Dexterity) to the Strength minimum, and rolls (Perception or Dexterity + Craft) instead of (Strength + Athletics). If she succeeds, she can choose to disassemble the object rather than break it - she might end up with a pile of stone blocks or wooden beams rather than rubble, for example.

  At Essence 3+, reduce the minimum Strength requirement for the feat by 2.

  \charm{Crack-Mending Technique}
  {10m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Craft 5, Craftsman Needs No Tools}
  This charm supplements a repair project for a non-magical item, allowing the Solar to repair impossibly damaged items, as long as a piece of the original remains. The repair takes as long as it would to create the item from scratch. Splintered wood can be made whole, a half-burnt manuscript returned to perfect legibility, a melted lump of metal returned to its form as a sword.

  \permanentCharm{Benevolent Worker's Joy}
  {Craft 5, Crack-Mending Technique}
  The first time the Solar uses Craft to help someone else each day, she gains 1wp. In addition, while using Craft to help people other than herself she recovers motes as though she were resting.

  \charm{Durability-Enhancing Technique}
  {5m}
  {Simple}{Instant}{-}
  {Craft 5, Craftsman Needs No Tools}
  The Solar spends five minutes to an hour (depending on the target's size) treating an object no larger than (Essence + 2) yards in radius, increasing the difficulty to damage it by 2 or (Essence), whichever is higher. This bonus is permanent.

  \charm{Master Craftsman's Eye}
  {4m}
  {Reflexive}{Indefinite}{-}
  {Craft 5, Essence 2, Supreme Masterwork Focus}
  The Solar may activate this charm whenever she sees an artifact or other magical item, even if she has not yet recognized it as such. She makes an immediate (Perception + Craft) roll to assess the item - if she rolls at least 3 successes, she recognizes the work of anyone she's met or seen the work of before. With five successes, she learns the name of the item and a loose understanding of its purpose.

  \charm{Object-Strengthening Touch}
  {4m}
  {Simple}{One scene}{-}
  {Craft 5, Essence 2, Durability-Enhancing Technique}
  With a touch, the Solar increases the durability of an object up to (Essence * 5) yards in radius. This increases the difficulty to break it by (Essence + 1), and renders it extremely resistant to fire, acid, freezing, and other forms of damage.

  \charm{Cloth Of Steel}
  {5m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Craft 5, Essence 2, Object-Strengthening Touch, a specialty in tailoring}
  This Charm supplements an attempt to make a set of clothes. If the attempt succeeds, the clothes benefit from the effects of Durability-Enhancing Technique and count as light mundane armor. They look almost identical to normal clothes; a difficulty 5 Craft or Awareness roll is needed to notice their supernatural durability. When making unusually heavy clothing, the sort that might incur a mobility penalty, the Solar may instead have them count as medium mundane armor.

  \charm{Chaos-Resistance Preparation}
  {5m}
  {Simple}{Instant}{-}
  {Craft 5, Essence 2, Object-Strengthening Touch}
  The Lawgiver spends up an hour treating an object no more than (Essence) yards in radius. In the bordermarches of the wyld, the object and its wearer/wielder can go (Solar's Essence) weeks without rolling for exposure. This protection shortens to days in the middlemarches and hours in the deep wyld.

  At Essence 3+, the Exalt may pay fifteen motes, one Willpower to use this Charm on the project scale, working for a full day to cover a considerable number of goods and vehicles or arms and armor, or perhaps a small ship.

  An Essence 5 repurchase extends the duration by two intervals.

  \charm{Philosophy Carved In Stone}
  {10m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Craft 5, Essence 2, Triumph-Forging Eye, a specialty in painting or sculpture}
  This Charm supplements an attempt to create a painting or a sculpture. If successful, the Solar rolls (Charisma or Manipulation + Craft) as a social influence roll that targets anyone who takes some time to examine the artwork. If she wishes to play on an Intimacy, she must name it as she works.

  The influential nature of the art is obvious - everyone can tell what the message is as long as they're familiar with the relevant characters and concepts.

  \charm{Living Statue Genesis}
  {5m}
  {Simple}{Indefinite}{Stackable}
  {Craft 4, Essence 2, Triumph-Forging Eye, a specialty in sculpture or clockwork}
  The Solar touches a statue or mechanical imitation of an animal that she's created. It springs to life and remains animate for as long as she keeps her motes committed. An animal created this way is in all ways like a normal animal, except that it can understand its creator's speech, it reliably obeys its creator's instructions, and it looks obviously inanimate. Animals imitated this way must be at least as large as a mouse and no larger than a dog.

  An Essence 3+ repurchase allows her to spend an additional 2m to animate creatures as large as a horse or tiger. Human statues animated in this way are no more intelligent than any other creation.

  An Essence 5 repurchase allows her to spend an additional 11m, 1wp (for a total of 18m, 1wp) to animate either a single statue or replica as large as a Tyrant Lizard or a magnitude 1 battle group of human-sized figures.

  \charm{The Art of Permanence}
  {6m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Craft 5, Essence 3, Chaos-Resistance Preparation}
  This charm supplements a Basic project or personal-scale non-magical Major project, causing it to endure forever. Candles burn eternally, a horse need never be shod again, a stone hut will endure the turning of the ages. Thy wyld will not twist it. This does not protect the items against intentional or sudden damage (a volcano or earthquake), only age and normal weathering.

  \charm{Attention-Demanding Artwork}
  {4m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Craft 5, Essence 3, Philosophy Carved In Stone}
  This Charm supplements an attempt to create a painting or a sculpture. If the attempt succeeds, the Solar may roll (Charisma or Manipulation + Craft). Anyone whose Resolve is less than half of her successes is unable to walk past the artwork without stopping to examine it unless they've already done so. In addition, anyone whose Resolve is less than the Solar's successes is unable to destroy the artwork or allow it to be destroyed. Spending 1wp allows him to ignore the art or an attempt to destroy it, while spending 2wp allows him to deliberately destroy the artwork.

  If this Charm is activated alongside its prerequisite, the Solar rolls only once. If multiple pieces of art enhanced with this Charm are present in a scene, a character may resist the effects of all of them with a single expenditure of willpower.

  \charm{Unbroken Image Focus}
  {6m}
  {Reflexive}{Instant}{Salient}
  {Craft 5, Essence 4, Master Craftsmans Eye}
  This charm supplements a Craft roll with disappearing 1s and 2s.

  \charm{Inspiration-Renewing Vision}
  {12m, 2wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Craft 5, Essence 5, Unbroken Image Focus, Flawless Example}
  This charm supplements a roll on a Major craft project. The roll does not count against the project's terminus. This charm may only be used once per project.
\end{Ability}

\begin{Ability}{Dodge}
  \charm{Reed in the Wind}
  {2i per 1 Evasion}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Dodge 3}
  This charm supplements a dodge, raising the Solar's Evasion it by 1 for every 2i spent. The first (Essence) Evasion gained in this way do not count against the normal dice-adding limits.

  At Essence 3+, if the attack misses she gains 1m. She may gain this bonus only once per round.

  \charm{Dust Motes Whirling}
  {2m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Dodge 4, Reed in the Wind}

\begin{Ability}{Larceny}
\begin{sidebar}{But my character's too Smart for that!}
  While it comes up in other abilities, Larceny in particular is subject to the difficulty of players running characters more intelligent than themselves. Here are some tips for the Storyteller on how to work with your players.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Cooperate with the players. When they roll well high on Larceny, work together with them on a plan - it doesn't have to be super intelligent, just "smart enough." Help them figure out how to bypass obstacles, and, here's the important bit, don't add more. Let them bypass trouble, and skip to the interesting bits!
    \item When contingencies come up, let them have already planned for them. Cornered by guards? "Good thing my character memorized the map, and there's another way out of here." The rules for Introducing a Fact with Lore are a good starting point.
    \item If something comes up after the fact, ask how their character took care of it, rather than assuming they didn't. Did they forget that a servant's dress uniform would be missed the next day? It's a chance to show off how bright the character was, taking care of it in advance, rather than playing gotcha with the player.
  \end{itemize}

  Obviously none of this is universal - characters can and should mess up. But it is a starting point on how to make criminal masterminds just as fun to play as brawny warlords.
\end{sidebar}

  \permanentCharm{Seasoned Criminal Method}
  {Larceny 1}
  The Solar may adopt or discard any of the following effects reflexively:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Familiarity: She may treat all members of criminal organizations as though they had a Minor Tie of familiarity towards her. They're likely to believe she is a fellow criminal with whom to be treated: a member of the organization, a prospect for initiation, etc.
    \item Dissonance: Magistrates or other officials seeking to establish her identity suffer a -2 penalty to their Bureaucracy and Investigation actions. Minor characters who do not know her personally but have seen her hanging around the scene of a crime cannot remember doing so.
    \item Vulnerability: The Exalt makes herself seem the best possible target for a specific type of crime. Confidence men will see an easy mark, gamblers will try to take advantage, thugs will try to mug her, etc.
    \item Receptivity: Criminals who spot her as someone who will partake of their particular vice. She might be seen as a drug buyer or seller, someone looking to hire a prostitute, or similar. Such parties will be likely to provide her with information about where to go and who to talk to.
  \end{itemize}

  \charm{Spurious Presence}
  {6m}
  {Simple}{One scene}{-}
  {Larceny 2, Seasoned Criminal Method}
  As long as the Solar fits into a scene reasonably well and acts as expected for the situation, minor characters receive no Awareness rolls to notice that she's out of place unless they are on special alert.

  This charm may be activated when someone discovers the Solar somewhere she doesn't belong.

  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Mute}
  {Larceny 5, Essence 3, Flawlessly Impenetrable Disguise}
  This charm supplements a Disguise action. It takes only a single action, rather than the usual 5 minutes.

  \charm{Split Deception Method}
  {5m}
  {Reflexive}{Indefinite}{Stackable}
  {Larceny 5, Essence 3, Perfect Mirror}
  The Solar may activate this charm when she finishes a Disguise action. She immediately makes another Disguise action. When later seen by other characters, the Solar chooses which disguise each witness or group of witnesses sees. If she's unaware of them, they see the final one donned. She may have this charm active no more than (Essence) times at once.

  \charm{Unbroken Darkness Approach}
  {1m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Mute, Once/Scene}
  {Larceny 5, Essence 4, Living Shadow Preparedness}
  The Solar supplements a Larceny roll with a full Excellency. Any charms supplementing the same roll gain the Mute keyword.

\begin{Ability}{Linguistics}
  \charm{Whirling Brush Method}
  {3m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Mute}
  {Linguistics 1}
  This charm supplements a Linguistics action to copy an existing document (or a short portion of one) or to create a written work requiring little creativity or careful consideration. This action takes two intervals less time. It may also be used to transcribe a spoken conversation - the Solar can keep up with a rapid conversation involving multiple parties.

  \charm{Flawless Brush Discipline}
  {1m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Linguistics 3, Whirling Brush Method}
  This charm supplements a Linguistics action to copy from an existing document. The Solar rolls (Dexterity or Manipulation + Linguistics) with disappearing 1s and 2s to set the difficulty others must meet in order to tell the copy apart from the original (usually with Perception + Linguistics). This charm affects only the written or drawn parts of the work - it doesn't aid in copying an indented seal, for example.

  An Essence 2+ repurchase also allows the Solar to mimic a target's handwriting, word choice, and demeanor without directly copying the document - she could forge countermanding orders or create a new "lost work" with the same benefits.

  \charm{Letter-Within-A-Letter Technique}
  {4m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Mute}
  {Linguistics 3}
  This charm supplements writing a document. The Solar infuses it with meaning for a specific recipient, who automatically notices and understands. She rolls (Manipulation + Linguistics) to set the difficulty others must meet to notice anything amiss with the document (usually Perception + Linguistics), and only with 3 threshold successes can they understand the hidden message.

  At Essence 3+ the roll gains disappearing 1s.

  \charm{Subtle Speech Method}
  {3m}
  {Supplemental}{One idea conveyed}{Mute}
  {Linguistics 3}
  This charm supplements an attempt to convey information covertly during another conversation. Only the intended targets hear the subtext (which may be completely unrelated to what the conversation seemed to be about). Attempts by other listeners to notice any covert meaning automatically fail.

  \charm{Flowing Elegant Hand}
  {2m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Mute}
  {Linguistics 3}
  This charm supplements any written Linguistics action, granting it double 9s.

  \charm{Strange Tongue Understanding}
  {1m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Linguistics 3}
  This charm supplements an attempt to understand a spoken sentence or similarly short statement in a language the Solar doesn't know. She automatically learns the gist of it, and may roll (Intelligence + Linguistics) vs. a difficulty determined by the Storyteller to understand the exact meaning, ranging from 1 ("Get out now") to 5 ("The enemy will be reinforced with 35 additional vessels tomorrow afternoon").

  At Essence 2+, she may spend an additional 4m to extend the duration to "One scene."

  \charm{Mingled Tongue Technique}
  {4m, 1wp + 3m per extra language}
  {Supplemental}{One scene}{-}
  {Linguistics 5, Strange Tongue Understanding}
  This charm supplements an attempt to speak to a group. The Solar chooses two languages she knows - for the rest of the scene she may speak in a way comprehensible to speakers of either. She may add any number of additional languages to the mix, paying an additional 3m for each.

  \charm{Sagacious Reading of Intent}
  {4m, 1wp}
  {Reflexive}{Instant}{-}
  {Linguistics 4}
  After reading a text, the Solar may activate this charm to make a (Perception + Linguistics) roll at difficulty equal to the Linguistics roll used to create the work. If successful, she learns any intimacies or lack thereof that went into writing the text - she might learn that the author didn't believe what they wrote, or that he was in love with the person he was writing to.

  \charm{Moving the Unseen Hand}
  {4m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Mute}
  {Linguistics 5, Essence 2, Flawless Brush Discipline x2}
  This charm supplements writing an unsigned message. The Exalt rolls (Manipulation + Linguistics), and chooses an effect:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item The reader believes the document was written by a specific person of the Solar's choice. This variation may also be supplemented by Flawless Brush Discipline (make a single roll which applies to both charms).
    \item The reader believes the message was written by the person they most wish it were from.
    \item If the Solar has Bureaucracy 3+, she can choose to make the reader assume it was written by a hierarchical superior.
  \end{itemize}

  Whenever anyone reads the document, compare this roll against their Resolve. If successful, they are taken in.

  \charm{Voice-Caging Calligraphy}
  {2m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Mute, Psyche}
  {Linguistics 5, Essence 2, Letter-Within-A-Letter Technique}
  This charm supplements writing a letter or other brief work. The reader may not share the contents of the letter with anyone else - he forgets what he was going to say, writes nothing, or otherwise fails to act upon his intention to do so unless he spends 5wp to end the effect. If one of his Defining intimacies is threatened, the cost drops to to 2wp.

  \charm{Vanishing Immersion Style}
  {1m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Linguistics 5, Essence 2}
  This charm supplements the Solar's Guile against any Read Intentions action made against her while she's reading. The attempt fails.

  \charm{Discerning Savant's Eye}
  {1m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{One scene}{-}
  {Linguistics 5, Essence 2, Sagacious Reading of Intent}
  This charm supplements an attempt to read or copy a damaged text, allowing the Exalt to ignore the damage as long as some fragment remains.

  \charm{Excellent Emissary's Tongue}
  {6m}
  {Reflexive}{Indefinite}{-}
  {Linguistics 5, Essence 2, Mingled Tongue Technique}
  The Solar may use this charm when she hears an unfamiliar language being spoken. She learns the language, both written and spoken, though she retains a -3 penalty to social influence in the new language until the charm has been active for a week. If she uses the language (and the charm remains active) for more than a season, she learns the language naturally, and the knowledge does not fade with the end of the charm.

  \charm{Power-Snaring Image}
  {1m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Linguistics 5, Essence 3, Flawless Brush Discipline x2}
  This charm supplements copying a text. The Solar duplicates any magic in the text (such as Moving the Unseen Hand) into the copy without paying the cost if she knows the charm.

  At Essence 5+, she may copy effects she does not know, as long as she meets the magic's trait minimums.

  \charm{Flashing Quill Atemi}
  {1m}
  {Simple}{One minute}{-}
  {Linguistics 5, Essence 3, Power-Snaring Image}
  The Solar edits an existing document - changing words on the page, adding or removing text, adjusting tone. This destroys any existing social influence or magic encoded in the text, though she may add her own as though she were writing the document herself. She rolls (Manipulation + Linguistics) with double 8s - any reader must meet that difficulty with a (Perception + Linguistics) roll to notice the document has been altered.

  If this action is also supplemented with Power-Snaring Image, she may choose to keep the original magic intact (as per that charm).

  \charm{Mind-Swallowing Missive}
  {8m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Indefinite}{Psyche}
  {Linguistics 5, Essence 3, Voice-Caging Calligraphy}
  This charm supplements writting a document meant for a specific reader. The Solar rolls (Manipulation + Linguistics). When her target reads the document, he rolls (Perception + Linguistics), and if the Solar had more successes, forgets every language he knows. He learns a new one on the spot previously unheard in Creation. He may end the effect by spending (Solar's Essence) willpower.

  \charm{Twisted Words Technique}
  {1m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Psyche}
  {Linguistics 5, Essence 3, Flowing Elegant Hand, Letter Within-A-Letter Technique, Subtle Speech Method}
  This charm supplements social influence of any ability. Though the target applies Intimacies as normal for the apparent effect, the influence has an actual effect opposite of that - if it seems like it should strengthen an intimacy, it weakens it instead. For example, the Solar might make a passionate speech on the evils of harlotry which forms an Intimacy of support in her listeners.

  This influence can always be resisted by spending 1wp, regardless of intimacies.

  \charm{Perfect Recollection Discipline}
  {1m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Linguistics 5, Essence 3, Discerning Savant's Eye}
  This charm supplements reading a book or other document of any length. The Solar retains the text perfectly, and can flip through it mentally as though it were in her hands. If she retains the 1m commitment for a season, the the information becomes innate and does not fade if she ends the charm.

  \charm{Swift Sage's Eye}
  {1m}
  {Supplemental}{One text}{Mute}
  {Linguistics 5, Essence 3, Perfect Recollection Discipline}
  This charm supplements reading a book or other document. The Exalt reads as quickly as she can unroll a scroll or turn pages (approximately two per second) with full comprehension.

  \charm{Heaven-Drawing Discipline}
  {8m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Mute}
  {Linguistics 5, Essence 3, Perfect Recollection Discipline}
  This charm supplements an action to write a book or other long work taking at least a couple days to compose. The action takes one less interval of time.

  At Essence 5 the Exalt may pay a 4m surcharge to reduce the time required by a second interval.

  \charm{Unbreakable Fascination Method}
  {6m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Indefinite}{Psyche}
  {Linguistics 5, Essence 4, Twisted Words Technique}
  The Solar speaks, and rolls (Manipulation + Linguistics) with (Essence) automatic successes, applying it against the Resolve of everyone listening. Anyone who's Resolve is met is held enraptured until she ceases speaking, even those who do not understand her language. The charm ends if the listeners come under direct physical danger.

  This charm may instead be used to supplement a written work - if it is, as long as the Solar leaves the motes committed, anyone who reads even a single line is required to spend at least (Solar's Essence) minutes reading more of the text.

\begin{Ability}{Lore}
  \charm{Wyld-Dispelling Prana}
  {5m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Varies}{-}
  {Lore 2}
  This charm supplements a defense against the soul or body twisting power of the wyld, either on the Solar or on an object, structure or character within Short range. The target ignores the effect, and the Lawgiver rolls ([Wits, Perception or Intelligence] + Lore), with (Essence) automatic successes against a difficulty of 1 for the bordermarches, 5 for the middlemarches or 7 for the deep wyld. The charm lasts (threshold successes) minutes out of combat or that many rounds in-combat. Ignore the wp cost on subsequent activations during the same scene.

  \charm{Chaos-Repelling Pattern}
  {10m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{One hour}{-}
  {Lore 3, Wyld-Dispelling Prana}
  The area around the Solar out to short range behaves according to the laws of Creation - it will not twist character's souls as the wyld, nor will the ground transform beneath her feet. This does nothing to protect against direct attacks or prevent the environment from being harmful. If she chooses to reactivate the charm at the end of the hour, ignore the willpower cost.

  \permanentCharm{Harmonious Academic Methodology}
  {Lore 3}
  The Solar gains (Essence) automatic successes on Lore rolls to introduce facts. At the end of each story, she may gain one Lore specialty she spent time learning about in the past story, without spending experience.

  \charm{Flowing Mind Prana}
  {4m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Varies}{-}
  {Lore 4, Harmonious Academic Methodology}
  The Lawgiver spends time teaching or training a willing pupil. He gains one dot of an attribute or ability of the Solar's choice, up to a maximum of what she herself possesses. This takes one increment less than the normal training time. If he tracks experience points (another PC, for example), he must pay for the new dot as normal. In addition, she may teach her pupil any intimacy she possesses, creating it at Minor or strengthening it - he may not resist this, having already agreed to become her student.

  An Essence 2+ repurchase allows her to train up to (Essence * 5) characters at the same time with a single use of this charm.
  As Essence 3+ repurchase allows her to teach a single Charm or Spell that her pupils otherwise meet the prerequisites for instead of the normal dot, and she may give pupils intimacies she does not possess.

  \charm{Essence-Lending Method}
  {3m}
  {Simple}{Instant}{-}
  {Lore 1}
  The Solar touches a target, and may transfer up to (Essence * 3) motes from her own personal or peripheral pool to her target. This may bring him above his normal maximum, but any excess motes dissipate at the end of his next action.

  The first time during a scene she uses this charm, the Solar rolls (Wits + Lore) and grants her target that many additional motes without spending any herself.

  \charm{Will-Bolstering Method}
  {5m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Instant}{-}
  {Lore 2, Essence-Lending Method}
  The Exalt touches a target and transfers up to (Essence) willpower to them, which may increase them past their normal limit. She also rolls a single die with double 10s - he gains a 1wp for each success.

  \charm{Hidden Wisdom Bestowal}
  {10m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{One scene}{Mute}
  {Lore 5, Essence 2, Flowing Mind Prana}
  This charm supplements any action to teach someone, disguising the Solar's lessons as harmless regardless of their true content. Only the target understands the true meaning of her lessons. She might teach demonolgy while discussing the Immaculate texts during a casual stroll, or teach brawling during a dance lesson.

  \charm{Truth-Rendering Gaze}
  {6m}
  {Simple}{Indefinite}{Mute}
  {Lore 5, Essence 2, Harmonious Academic Methodology}
  The Solar spends at least five minutes examining a map or schematic. She then gains (Essence) automatic successes on Strategic Maneuver rolls or Survival rolls to gather supplies or navigate within the area.

  \permanentCharm{Essence Font Technique}
  {Lore 4, Essence 2, Will-Bolstering Method}
  This charm allows the Solar to combine Essence-Lending Method and Will-Bolstering Method in a single action. If so combined, reduce the total cost to 5m and the rolls for those charms gain exploding 10s.

  At Essence 3+ she may use those charms (individually or combined) at short range, without needing to touch the target.

  \charm{Essence-Draining Touch}
  {1wp}
  {Simple}{Instant}{-}
  {Lore 5, Essence 3, Essence Font Technique}
  This Solar touches a target with a mote pool, and rolls (Wits + Lore) against his Resolve. She steals up to (threshold successes) of his motes, starting with peripheral and moving on to personal if he runs out. If used on an unwilling target in combat, this requires a difficulty 2 gambit with Brawl, Martial Arts or Melee.

  \charm{Force-Draining Whisper}
  {10m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Post-roll, Once/Scene}
  {Lore 5, Essence 3, Essence-Draining Touch}
  This charm supplements defense against a decisive attack after it has hit. The Exalt rolls (Wits + Lore) with (Essence) automatic successes, and reduces the of the attack by that many dice. In addition, she gains that much initiative.

  Force-Draining Whisper can be reset if she or any of her allies reaches their last health level.

  At Essence 4+, she may also use this charm to supplement the defense of an ally at up to Long range.

  \charm{Power-Restoring Invocation}
  {2i, 3a}
  {Simple}{Instant}{-}
  {Lore 5, Essence 3, Essence Lending Method}
  The Solar rolls (Perception + Lore) with (Essence) automatic successes, granting that many motes of essence divided as she chooses among herself and any allies within Extreme range.

  At Essence 5, she may use this charm even in crash, spending herself into negative initiative.

  \charm{Order-Affirming Blow}
  {15m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Instant}{-}
  {Lore 5, Essence 3, Chaos-Repelling Pattern}
  The Solar touches a target, and shatters any mind, body or soul-twisting effects of the wyld upon him, returning him to his natural state. This does not affect sorcery or other, more arcane manipulations. If used on an unwilling target in combat, this requires a difficulty 5 gambit with Brawl, Martial Arts or Melee.

  If used upon a Fair Folk, they instead transform, assuming a fixed form for (Solar's Essence) scenes. The form they're forced into depends upon their nature, but always exposes them as blatantly inhuman without harming them.

  \charm{Wyld-Shaping Technique}
  {15m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Instant}{-}
  {Lore 5, Essence 3, Order Affirming Blow, Truth-Rendering Gaze}
  The Solar stands at the edge of the world - at least the border between the Middlemarches and the Deep Wyld, or possibly even further into chaos - and begins to shape chaos into form in a dramatic action that lasts fifteen minutes (which may be flurried if combat begins, as it likely will). She may activate Chaos-Repelling Prana without paying its cost, but any other similar effects within three range bands end immediately. While shaping the wyld, she will almost certainly be attacked. Roll one die:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item 1-4: No encounter
    \item 5-7: A small group of hobgoblins, pumpkin-men or other weak enemies, led by one or more fair-folk nobles.
    \item 8-10: A powerful wyldshaped monster or raksha hunting party
    \item 11+: A number of powerful wyld creatures or hundreds of weaker fair-folk and several raksha lords. Or perhaps even a behemoth, angry at having its slumber disturbed
  \end{itemize}

  If she survives and remains in the area until her shaping is completed, she makes an (Intelligence + Lore) roll, difficulty 5. On a failure, Wyld-Shaping Technique may not be used in the same area again for a year and a day. If successful, she forces the wyld to retreat from (Essence x 10) square miles, adding that area to Creation. The land or water so formed matches the general surroundings, with similar climate, geography, wildlife and spirits (all of whom have an intimacy centered on the character in some way, not necessarily positive).

  Further activations of Wyld-Shaping Technique in the same area add a cumulative +1 to the die roll to see what attention she attracts, and +1 difficulty on the lore roll (the third activation is at +2 to the roll and +2 difficulty, for example). She may:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Add more land. Subsequent activations add (Essence x 30, 100, 300, 1000) square miles successively.
    \item Reduce the created land (and all subsequently created land) by a factor of ten, and reshape it to match a specific form and naturalistic layout - she could create a desert in the midst of the lush East, or a lush lake deep in the Southern sands.
    \item Choose the flora and fauna of the created land, or grant it natural resources. She could fill her lake with fish, the desert with savage predators, add a vein of gold, etc.
    \item Add portable, ready-made wealth to the land, such as silver nuggets ready for the picking from a stream or rubies scattered in the remains of a landslide. The first time this is chosen, the items are worth resources 2 - a second, third and fourth invocation can up it to resources 3, 4 and 5 respectively.
    \item Add a Minor demesne to the created land matching its elemental aspect, raise a Minor one to Major, or change the aspect of any demanse.
    \item If there is a demanse of the appropriate aspect, she can change a mundane resource into a similar magical one, turning the vein of gold into orichalcum or marble into jade.
    \item If the land already has a vein of a magical material, she she may form a readily-accessible quantity of it - a single ingot's worth with one invocation, half a tallent with two, or a full talent with three (enough for a single grand daiklave).
  \end{itemize}

  When she stops activating Wyld-Shaping Technique, the newly created area settles into stability - Wyld-Shaping Technique may no longer be used there, and if she's adjacent to Creation, the middlemarches behind her will slowly stabilize over the coming weeks and months. If left uninhabited, the land may dissolve back into chaos over time, like any other part of Creation.

  \permanentCharm{Wyld Cauldron Mastery}
  {Lore 5, Essence 4, Wyld-Shaping Technique}
  Reduce the difficulty of Wyld-Shaping Technique's Lore rolls by 1 and they gain double 8s. In addition, on subsequent activations (after creating the initial land), she gains two additional options:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item She creates a new person. They are a mortal human, with a Major intimacy of the Solar's choice. The rest of their details are fleshed out by the storyteller.
    \item If she's already created a person, she can define another of their intimacies (at any level), grant them an area of expertise (an attribute or ability rated 3-4 dots), or give them an innate merit.
  \end{itemize}

  An Essence 5 repurchase reduces the cost of Wyld-Shaping Technique by 5m, and grants the rolls double 7s.

  \charm{Power-Awarding Prana}
  {10m}
  {Simple}{Indefinite}{Mute, Stackable}
  {Lore 5, Essence 4, Essence Font Technique, Flowing Mind Prana x 3}
  The Solar touches another Lawgiver, and grants him knowledge of one of her charms he meets the minimums and prerequisites for. As long as she maintains this charm, he may use it as though he had learned it himself.

  At Essence 5, she may also teach any charm that her student meets the prerequisites for, even if he does not meet the trait minimums.

  \charm{Will-Shattering Illusion}
  {10m}
  {Simple}{Instant}{Mute, Once/Scene}
  {Lore 5, Essence 4, Force Draining Whisper}
  The Solar rolls (Wits + Lore) with (Essence) bonus dice against a target within Long range, and he contests with ([Intelligence or Wits] + Lore). If she's successful, he loses 2wp, and (if in combat) she steals 4i. If he has equal or greater Essence, she also gains 1wp.

  \charm{Surging Inner Fire}
  {0m}
  {Simple}{Special}{Once/Scene}
  {Lore 5, Essence 4, Power-Restoring Invocation}
  The Solar gains 2m for each point her temporary willpower is lower than her permanent score. In addition, if she's in combat, she gains an additional 1m at the end of each round. The charm ends when she is struck by an attack that does Withering damage, or when combat ends.

  {Medicine 2}
  The Solar spends an hour treating a patient with herbs or other remedies appropriate to his disease, and rolls (Intelligence + Medicine) against the disease's Morbidity. As long as he spends his time resting and cared for, he receives half of her threshold successes on his next resistance roll.

  With a repurchase at Medicine 3+, if she rolls twice the disease's Morbidity, she may spend an additional 3m to end it immediately - her patient recovers from the disease over the course of a day.

  \charm{Wound-Mending Care Technique}
  {5m}
  {Simple}{Instant}{-}
  {Medicine 3}
  The Solar spends an hour doctoring a patient with bandages, herbs or other remedies and rolls (Intelligence + Medicine) against the highest wound penalty he suffers (5 for incapacitated). If he remains in bed for the rest of the day, he heals (Solar's Essence or three, whichever's higher) levels of Bashing or Lethal damage.

  \charm{Wound-Cleansing Meditation}
  {10m}
  {Simple}{Instant}{-}
  {Medicine 3, Wound-Mending Care Technique}

  {7m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Until treatment ends}{-}
  {Medicine 5, Essence 3, Instant Treatment Methedology}
  This Lawgiver begins treating a patient with some sort of permanent debilitation. The Storyteller should decide if this is Minor, Major or Defining. She begins an extended (Intelligence + Medicine) roll, difficulty 5 and terminus 5. The interval and goal depends on the severity.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Minor - Goal 10, interval one hour. Minor debilitates include major scars, missing ears, simple wyld mutations and Minor derangements.
    \item Major - Goal 20, interval one day. Major debilitates include congenital blindness, missing hands and Major derangements.
    \item Defining - Goal 30, interval one week. Defining debilitates include missing limbs, burned out eyes and Defining derangements.
  \end{itemize}

  If she succeeds in the extended roll, her patient is cured of the issue at hand. If she botches a roll or fails to reach the goal inside the Terminus, the Solar may not try again until she learns a new Medicine charm.

  {Medicine 5, Essence 5, Wholeness-Restoring Meditation}
  The Solar takes her patient to the wyld, and spends at least a day applying powerful herbs, operating, or otherwise working on her patient as appropriate to her methods. She selects an Innate merit, and begins an extended (Perception or Intelligence + Medicine) roll, interval one day in the bordermarches or one one hour on the middlemarches. The difficulty is equal to (sum of the dots of all his existing innate merits + dots of the new one). The Storyteller should estimate the dots of innate merits possessed by an NPC without a full character sheet. The goal is 5 * dots of new merit, and there is no terminus.

  If she succeeds, her patient gains the mutation. If he tracks experience, he must pay for it as though it were a purchased Merit. If she botches or abandons the project before completion (or her patient escapes), he instead gains one or more mutations of the Storyteller's choice (often starting with Hideous) related to the attempted change.

  She may substitute a sufficiently advanced and well supplied laboratory for the wyld energy of the bordermarches by committing an additional 5m.

She can see immaterial spirits, the borders of shadowlands, wyld energy, the entrances to spirit sanctums and similar.

  {Simple}{One scene}{-}
  {Occult 3, Essence 2, Spirit-Cutting Attack}
  The Exalt forms a barrier of visible essence around herself, extending out to short range. It remains fixed, and the charm ends if she steps outside the area. Spirits with Essence equal to or lower than hers must either materialize (using their own powers) or leave the circle and be unable to attack characters within. Against spirits with higher Essence, she may roll (Wits + Occult) with (Essence) bonus dice against their Resolve to force the same choice on them. Against demons and other cursed spirits, she instead gains (Essence) bonus successes.

If successful, the spirit may not voluntarily move for (threshold successes + 1) rounds, at which point the difficulty increases by one and she may roll again, repeating until she fails a roll. Spirits so trapped become material, without cost to themselves until released, and may not attack unless they're attacked first. The charm ends immediately if the Solar moves further from the spirit than medium range.

  With an Essence 3+ repurchase, creatures trapped are at -1 resolve, and the Solar gains a bonus success on all social influence attempts against them. In addition, she may have the spirit lose (Spirit's Essence) motes each round. If she does, the cost of her occult charms is reduced by the same amount.

  {Simple}{One Scene}{-}
  {Occult 5, Essence 3, Spirit-Manifesting Word x2}
  All spirits within Extreme range may roll (Wits + Dodge) against a difficulty (Solar's temporary willpower).

Ghosts may choose to go immediately into lethe rather than materialize.

  \charm{Spirit-Shredding Exorcism}
  {5m, 1 wp}
  {Reflexive}{Instant}{-}
  {Occult 5, Essence 4, Spirit-Caging Mandala x2}
  This charm may be activated whenever the Lawgiver succeeds at a (Wits + Occult) roll for the prerequisite charm. She rolls (Intelligence + Occult) against the spirit's Resolve, which may not be enhanced by intimacies. If successful, her victim's permanent Essence is reduced by 1 until the end of the scene (which may remove access to powers he no longer meets the prerequisites for), and she resets the difficulty of the roll to cage the spirit.

  Subsequent activations of this charm in a scene on the same spirit waive the wp cost. If a spirit is reduced to essence 0, the Solar may choose to either permanently destroy it or keep it trapped without further rolls, and the duration of Spirit-Caging Mandala becomes "one scene."

  \charm{Ephemeral Induction Technique}

  {Simple}{Instant}{-}
  {Occult 5, Essence 5, All Souls Benediction, Spirit-Caging Mandala x3}

While it will rapidly grow into whatever role it's given, it begins with only the most basic of spirit or fair folk charms.

  Each time the season changes, she may release her current familiar created with this charm. Until she does so, she cannot use this charm again.

  \permanentCharm{Celestial Circle Sorcery}

  \charm{Most Excellent Mockingbird}
  {3m}
  {Reflexive}{One scene}{-}

  {3m}
  {Reflexive}{Instant}{-}
  {Performance 4, Masterful Performance Exercise}
  The Solar may activate this charm after making love to another willing character. If he has a positive intimacy for her, it strengthens one step - if he does not, he forms one, or a negative intimacy weakens one step. She gains two automatic successes on social influence against him for (Solar's Essence) weeks.

  \charm{Mood-Inducing Music}
  {1m}
  {Simple}{One song}{-}
  {Performance 4}
  The Solar sings, plays an instrument or dances in support of a specific mood. All social influence by other characters that plays on the mood gains (Solar's Essence) bonus dice - all opposed influence takes a (Solar's Essence or 3, whichever's higher) penalty.

  \charm{Shining Expression Style}
  {2m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Performance 4, Masterful Performance Exercise}
  This charm supplements any Performance-based Inspire action. Characters affected by the influence don't realize that the Solar was the source - her motions or sounds seem like harmless background, underscoring rather than causing whatever emotion is aroused.

  \charm{Soul-Firing Performance}
  {4m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Group, Once/Scene}
  {Performance 4, Masterful Performance Exercise}
  This charm supplements a Performance based Persuade action. It gains (Essence) automatic successes, and the Solar does not need to spend willpower to overturn any influence her attempt is opposed to.

  \charm{Phantom-Conjuring Performance}
  {2m}
  {Supplemental}{One Performance}{-}
  {Performance 4, Essence 2, Respect-Commanding Attitude}
  This charm supplements any Performance. The Exalt conjures phantom images around her within short range, following along with her performance and aiding it. Apparitions might be other characters seeming to curl out of the smoke of a fire, hints of scenery seen in sunbeams, or rain hitting roof sounding like war-drums to match her tale.

  \permanentCharm{Stillness-Drawing Meditation}

  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Group}
  {Performance 4, Essence 2, Soul-Firing Performance}
  This charm supplements a Performance-based Inspire action by singing or with an instrument. If it succeeds, its targets must act on the roused emotion immediately - they cannot resolve to do so at a later date, or decide on a course of action that cannot be implemented within the next day.

  \charm{Master Thespian Style}
  {2m}
  {Simple}{One scene}{-}
  {Performance 4, Essence 2, Masterful Performance Exercise}
  The Exalt spends five minutes assuming a role. Against Read Intentions actions, her Guile increases by 1, and she calculates it with Performance rather than Socialize. Characters who fail at a Read Intentions action believe they've succeeded, picking up on her character's intimacies or motivations, rather than her true feelings. She may activate this charm reflexively (no preparation needed) with a suitably dramatic entrance.

  \charm{Fury Inciting Speech}
  {5m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{One Scene}{Group}
  {Performance 4, Essence 2, Masterful Performance Exercise}
  This charm supplements an Inspire action on a crowd to draw up anger at an injustice. Crowds roused this way will generally form violent, angry mobs. Any battle groups formed by the mob have their drill increased by one level, from Poor to Average - or if she somehow manages to rally a mob of soldiers, from Average to Elite.

  \charm{Infectious Zealotry Approach}
  {3m, 1wp}
  {Reflexive}{One Scene}{-}
  {Performance 5, Essence 2, Fury Inciting Speech}
  With a meaningful glance or supportive nod, the Solar selects an intimacy she thinks her target has, and rolls ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Performance) against his Resolve, unmodified by Intimacies. If successful, and he actually has that intimacy, he treats it as one level more intense until the end of the scene. If she supports a Defining intimacy in this way, her target becomes obsessed, and neglects all other cares in favor of fulfilling his obsession.

  \charm{Winding Sinuous Motion}
  {4m}
  {Simple}{One Scene}{-}
  {Performance 5, Essence 2, Shining Expression Style}
  The Solar spends at least ten minutes dancing. Anyone not her ally who sees her motions - whether he pays attention or not - suffers a -1 penalty on his Resolve for the rest of the scene.

  \charm{Battle Anthem (of the Solar Exalted)}
  {1m}
  {Simple}{One round}{-}
  {Performance 5, Essence 2, Mood-Inducing Music}
  The Lawgiver sings or plays an instrument in battle. Each ally within long range gains 1i, and until her next action, their successful withering attacks grant +1i. Allied battle groups gain (Solar's Essence) bonus dice on their attacks and rout checks.

  With an Essence 3+ repurchase, each ally affected also gains 1m, and doubles any Intimacy-derived bonuses to Resolve. Allied battle groups gain (Solar's Essence) automatic successes when rallying for numbers.

  \charm{Dogmatic Contagion Discipline}
  {1m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{(Essence) days}{Group}
  {Performance 5, Essence 3, Infectious Zealotry Approach}
  This charm supplements a Performance-based Inspire action using oratory on a crowd. Up to (Solar's Essence + 1) threshold successes on the roll become bonus dice on all social rolls by minor characters to express or act on their roused emotion, and for the purposes of passing on the influence. Other minor characters her disciples are able to convince gain the same bonuses.

  \charm{Soul-Bracing Momentous Power}
  {5m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Performance 5, Essence 3, Stillness-Drawing Meditation}
  This charm supplements a Performance-based social influence attempt. If the influence fails it repeats each day, up to (Solar's Essence) additional times or until it succeeds. All subsequent repeats use the same number of successes as the original and have the same effects, including any charms applied.

  \charm{Memory-Reweaving Discipline}
  {10m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Instant}{Psyche, Group}
  {Performance 5, Essence 3, Infectious Zealotry Approach, Winding Sinuous Motion}
  The Solar spends a minute or two spinning a tale, and rolls (Manipulation + Performance), subtracting successes rather than dice for any situational penalties (including bizarre, unbelievable or far-reaching claims). Each character or groups' Resolve she overcomes gains a Minor Intimacy of belief that her story is true. If she exceeds their Resolve by three or more, they instead gain a Major intimacy of belief.

  A character may only hold one such intimacy from the Solar at a time - until it's eroded entirely, any of her attempts to reuse this charm on him fail. If the intimacy erodes, he still has the false memory, but for whatever reason no longer believes it to be true.

  With an Essence 4+ repurchase, if the the Solar is targeting an individual, she may spend an additional 5m to compress this charm down to a single statement, rather than requiring minutes of narrative to build up the belief.

  \charm{Monk-Seducing Demon Dance}
  {4m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Group}
  {Performance 5, Essence 3, Winding Sinuous Motion}
  This charm supplements a dance-based Inspire action to arouse admiration or lust. If successful (remember that unacceptable influence always fails), the Solar becomes the target of the aroused emotion, rather than the target's player deciding.

  \charm{Demon Wracking Shout}
  {8m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Instant}{Once/Scene}
  {Performance 5, Essence 3, Respect-Commanding Attitude}
  The Solar shouts, a sound physically painful to demons and other dark spirits. She makes a single undodgeable (Charisma + Performance) Decisive attack with (Essence) automatic successes, applying it to all such creatures within Long range, including immaterial ones.

  \charm{Listener-Swaying Argument}
  {3m}

  \permanentCharm{Tiger's Dread Symmetry}
  {Presence 3}
  The first time in a scene a character wishes to attack the Solar from Stealth, he must either succeed on a ([Any Social Attribute] + Integrity) roll, difficulty (Solar's Essence), or spend 1wp.

  The Solar may choose to make her Threaten actions covert - characters other than her target must succeed at a reflexive Read Intentions action against her to notice the attempt.

  \charm{Harmonious Presence Meditation}
  {5m}
  {Reflexive}{One scene}{-}
  {Presence 3, Essence 1}
  This charm may be activated at any time. Threaten actions and Instill and Persuade actions to cause fear, anger or other negative emotions in the Lawgiver's presence suffer disappearing 7s.

  \permanentCharm{Excellent Friend Approach}
  {Presence 4, Essence 2, Harmonious Presence Meditation}
  When attempting a Persuade action against people who have a positive Tie to her, the Solar and her target treat that Intimacy as one step more powerful. If the Tie is already defining, increase the bonus or penalty from the Tie by one.

  \charm{Empowering Shout}
  {3m}
  {Simple}{One round}{-}
  {Presence 5, Essence 2, Listener-Swaying Argument}
  The Solar empowers one of her allies within Long range. She chooses one Attribute + Ability pool he has 7 or fewer dice in, and until her next action, her ally gains one automatic success to any rolls with that pool or +1 to any static value calculated with it. He also decreases the Strength minimum by one for any Feats of Strength he attempts.

  At Essence 3+, she may spend an additional 2m to double the bonus.

  {6m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Indefinite}{-}

  The Exalt touches someone who serves or follows her. Characters who have ties of loyalty to her feel the same way towards her champion, and recognize that he's acting at her behest.

  With an Essence 3+ repurchase, her target gains +2 Resolve against supernatural fear effects. If he cannot use essence, he gains a personal mote pool of 6m and learns the Solar Integrity Excellency.

  With an Essence 4+ repurchase, he may (as long as cannot use essence except by the effects of this charm) use any excellency that the Solar knows, as long as the supplemented action upholds or advances one of his Defining principles.

  \charm{Threefold Magnetic Ardor}
  {4m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Presence 4, Essence 2, Illustrious Solar Mien}
  This charm supplements any Instill, Persuade or Threaten attempt. Any bonus dice the Solar has from having higher Appearance than her target's Resolve become bonus successes instead. This does not count against the normal limits for adding dice / successes with a charm. In addition, treat her Appearance as one higher for calculating that bonus.

  \charm{Enemy-Castigating Solar Judgment}
  {3m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Presence 5, Essence 3, Tiger's Dread Symmetry}
  This charm supplements any decisive attack or social influence attempt against a creature of darkness or a character the Solar has a negative Defining Tie towards. That character's Defense or Resolve takes a -1 penalty. Influence enhanced this way costs an additional 1wp to resist, and attacks enhanced this way inflict aggravated damage. The Solar's other magic treats him as a creature of darkness for this attack/influence.

  This charm may be activated whenever the Solar's anima reaches the Iconic level. Out of combat, the Solar makes a single Threaten action and applies it to all characters out to Long range.

  In combat, any battle groups within Long range must make an immediate Rout check (this counts as a devastating area of effect assault), and on failure they lose a point of Size and restores all points of Magnitude rather than dissolving.

  \charm{Mind-Wiping Gaze}
  {1m, 1wp}
  {Reflexive}{One Scene}{Once/Scene per Target}
  {Presence 5, Essence 3, Terrifying Apparition of Glory}
  This charm may be activated at any time. The Solar chooses a specific type of social influence, such as "reveal my nature," "suggest an invasion," and locks eyes with her target. She rolls ([Charisma or Appearance] + Presence) against her target's Resolve (counting as a Threaten action for purposes of charms). If successful, he forgets about his desire to perform the named action until the charm ends. If reminded of the desire, he may spend 1wp to end the effect - otherwise, it slips from his mind again immediately.

  \charm{Hypnotic Tongue Technique}
  {10m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Indefinite}{Psyche, Mute, Once/Story per Target}
  {Presence 5, Essence 3, Mind-Wiping Gaze, Listener Swaying Argument}
  After interacting socially with her target for at least a minute, with small talk, business, or any other subject, the Solar rolls ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Presence) against her target's Resolve, which may not be modified by Intimacies. If successful, he goes catatonic for a second, allowing the Solar to implant (threshold successes + 1) short, clear sentences worth of instructions to be carried out at the same time, either immediately or at some future time. He may immediately spend 2wp to resist, forgetting the whole incident - if he does not, then at the specified time he takes the actions as long as none of them are obviously suicidal. He does not remember why he took those actions.

  \charm{Worshipful Lackey Acquisition}
  {12m}
  {Simple}{(Essence) days}{-}
  {Presence 5, Essence 3, Underling-Promoting Touch}
  The Solar spends several minutes talking with another character - or any number of minor characters - who have any Tie towards her, positive or negative. Her target(s) must roll (Wits + Integrity) against a difficulty of (Solar's strongest social attribute). If they fail, they must spend 2wp or gain a Defining intimacy placing them as the Solar's underlings. They may still hate her, but they can't help but cloy and defer to her. This intimacy disappears when the charm ends.

  For 2m, it supplements a defense against an unsoakable withering attack. The Solar may pay 2m to apply her stamina as soak. This use is Instant.

  For 6m, it supplements a defense against any Decisive attack. The Solar gains (Stamina) -0 Health Levels. At the end of the scene, any undamaged health levels so created disappear, and any damaged ones change to -1 instead of -0.

  The Solar gains a number of health levels depending on her Stamina:

  This Solar gains +1 die on all pools related to combat, and her wound penalties are reduced by one. Intimacies compelling her to fight - positive or negative - are treated as one level more intense (to a maximum of Defining), but she's unable to make social influence attempts more complex than simple threats or demands for surrender.

  The Solar's Sail rolls gain disappearing 6s. She automatically knows the exact distance and direction to any place she's sailed before.

  If she would be thrown from a ship for any reason (and she's not already dangling precariously over tho ocean by one hand), she always finds a rail, rope, or other hold that keeps her (however precariously) aboard.

  {Simple}{Instant}{-}
  {Sail 3}
  The Solar performs a five minute ceremony at the bow of a ship, claiming ownership of it. If no one objects, the vessel recognizes her as its master. Anyone she doesn't personally welcome aboard personally suffers a -1 penalty to all actions on the ship until she does so. Her welcome may be withdrawn from an individual at any time reflexively. She may only own one vessel at a time with this charm - using it on a new ship ends her old claim.

  The Solar signals to her fleet with mirrors, flags or other signalling devices. She rolls ([Charisma or Intelligence] + Sail); all allied ships that can see her orders gain (successes / 2, round up) bonus dice on their maneuver rolls this round.

  Each naval combat round for the rest of the scene, she may take an action to make a new roll, granting the bonus as above. If she doesn't (usually because she's a captain and chooses to roll a maneuver for her own ship, or is busy being boarded), the charm doesn't end, but no one benefits from her leadership that round.

\begin{Ability}{Socialize}
  \begin{sidebar}{Social Influence and Group Dynamics}
    Many Socialize charms have an effect on a particular culture or group - remember that these charms apply just as much to "the local fishermen" as they do to the politics and mores of the Tri-Khan's palace. Even small groups such as regulars at a specific tea shop often develop distinctive customs and habits that these charms can take advantage of.
  \end{sidebar}

  \charm{Mastery of Small Manners}
  {5m}
  {Reflexive}{One scene}{-}
  {Socialize 1}
  This charm may be activated at any time. The Exalt instinctively follows social customs for any culture she's immersed in - greeting, eating, flirting and responding as naturally as a native. She ignores all penalties for unfamiliarity with a culture, and will not unintentionally commit any major faux pas.

  Any characters with a negative Intimacy for foreigners or outsiders treats it as one level weaker when dealing with her. Any characters with positive intimacies towards the culture she's attuned herself to act as though they have a Minor Tie of respect as long as the charm lasts, if they don't already have a stronger positive Intimacy towards her.

  {2m}
  {Supplemental}{Indefinite}{Post-Roll, Stackable}

  \permanentCharm{Intent-Tracing Stare}
  {Socialize 4, Motive-Discerning Technique, Night Passes Over}
  The Solar becomes aware whenever she or someone she's interacting with is the target of a Read Intentions action. If she's aware of the person scrutinizing her (or succeeds on a Perception + Awareness roll to notice him), she also immediately knows who he is, even in the midst of a crowd.

  \charm{Indecent Proposal Method}
  {4m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}

  This charm supplements an ally with medium range's use of Guile. If the Solar wishes to be subtle (a gesture, stepping on his foot, a hiss), raise his Guile by one. If she's blatant (slapping him, interrupting his conversation or similar), raise his Guile by three.

  \charm{Easily-Discarded Presence Method}
  {4m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Post-roll}
  {Socialize 5, Essence 2, Night Passes Over}
  This charm supplements a successful defense against a Read Intentions action to discern the Solar's motives. The target believes he succeeded, and sees cluelessness, incompetence, pursuit of vice, straight-forward good intentions or some similarly harmless motive.

  As Essence 3+, she may instead allow him to see some method towards reaching his goals - an easy mark, a person who has the ear of someone important, or similar.

  \charm{Penumbra Self Meditation}
  {3m}
  {Simple}{Indefinite}{Stackable}
  {Socialize 4, Essence 2, Night Passes Over}

  {Supplemental}{Indefinite}{Post-roll, Stackable}
  {Socialize 5, Essence 2, Penumbra Self Meditation}
  This charm supplements the Solar's defense against a Read Intentions action after it has beaten her Guile. She immediately adopts a Minor or Major intimacy in line with what her questioner is looking to find, which he learns about instead of any of her real intimacies. This is a real intimacy as long as the charm lasts, influencing her actions and her Resolve just like any other of the same strength would. Ending this charm is the same scene it's activated costs 1wp.

  At Essence 3+ she may create a Defining intimacy as well.

  \charm{Cunning Insight Technique}
  {3m}
  {Reflexive}{Instant}{-}
  {Socialize 5, Essence 3, Mastery of Small Manners}

  {Reflexive}{Instant}{-}
  {Socialize 5, Essence 3, Discretionary Gesture}

  \charm{Wise Counsel}
  {6m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Indefinite}{-}
  {Socialize 5, Essence 3, Discretionary Gesture}
  The Solar spends a minute advising another character. He learns the Solar Socialize Excellency, and if he cannot already use essence, gains a personal mote pool of 6m. If he uses this charm, any positive Intimacy he has for the lawgiver increases in intensity, or he gains a Minor one if it doesn't already exist.

  \charm{Endless Obsession Feint}
  {3m}
  {Reflexive}{Reflexive}{-}
  {Socialize 5, Essence 3, Wise Counsel}
  The Solar may activate this charm whenever she achieves a significant goal through social influence at someone's expense. For the next (Solar's Essence) days the person she disadvantaged becomes obsessed with his defeat and with her, and suffers penalized 1s on any non-combat die rolls requiring careful concentration.

  At the end of this period, he develops a Major intimacy towards her, which can be positive or negative depending on how the his disposition and how the days went.

  \charm{Aspersions Cast Aside}
  {5m}
  {Reflexive}{Instant}{Mute}
  {Socialize 5, Essence 3, Indecent Proposal Method}
  The Solar may activate this charm after she's the target of a Socialize or Presence roll. The person who targeted her must make a (Wits + [Socialize or Presence]) roll with penalized 1s, difficulty (Solar's Essence or 3, whichever's greater) to maintain his composure. If he fails, he commits some breach of etiquette or clumsiness - spilling his wine in the gravy bowl, saying something ridiculous, etc.

  With a repurchase, increase the difficulty of the roll by 1, and she may also use this charm against influence directed at other's perceptions of her. She may also choose to make her target look malevolent or petty instead of clumsy.

  \charm{Seen and Seeing Method}
  {5m}
  {Reflexive}{Instant}{-}
  {Socialize 5, Essence 3, Intent-Tracing Stare}
  The Solar may activate this charm after she successfully defends against a Read Intentions action. She makes a Read Intentions action back at her watcher, whether or not she's aware of his location, or if he's even present (she could read the intentions of someone scrying on her or an immaterial spirit, for example).

  \charm{Blinding Soul Kata}
  {6m}
  {Reflexive}{Instant}{Psyche}
  {Socialize 5, Essence 3, Seen and Seeing Method, Inverted Ego Mask}
  This charm may be activated after the Solar successfully defends against a Read Intentions action. Unless her watcher spends 1wp, he's mesmerized by her charm, appearance, wit or some other facet of her personality, and enters a trance, unseeing and unhearing. He'll remain in this state for the rest of the scene, or until harshly shaken.

  \charm{Knowing the Soul's Price}
  {10m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Instant}{-}
  {Socialize 5, Essence 3, Wise-Eyed Courtier Method}

  {10m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Indefinite}{Mute}
  {Socialize 5, Essence 3, Inverted Ego Mask}
  The Solar spends an hour in quiet seclusion, building up a mental image of a new person. She chooses a new set of Intimacies matching her persona and gains those, replacing her real ones as long as the charm lasts. She *acts* (and gains Limit) according to her "real" intimacies, but uses her persona's intimacies for the all other purposes, such as social influence or magic which keys off her intimacies.

  Ending this charm costs 1wp. If her persona gained or strengthened any intimacies, those changes are reflected appropriately among her set (if her persona strengthened a Major intimacy that she doesn't share, she might gain a Minor version of the same intimacy, for example), resulting in confusion as her identities start to overlap.

  With an Essence 4+ repurchase, she may reduce the cost of this charm by 8m. If she does so, ending the charm costs 2wp.

  {Socialize 5, Essence 4, Knowing the Soul's Price}
  The Solar speaks to a group against one if its members she holds at least a Minor negative Tie towards, accusing him of betrayal, dereliction or perversion. She makes a single ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Socialize) Instill roll and applies it against everyone present.

  The relationships between the target of her accusations and everyone present are cursed - her target gains penalized 1s on all attempts to influence them socially. This curse fades after (Solar's Essence) days without contact between the accused character and the rest of the group.

  {Socialize 5, Essence 5, Heart-Eclipsing Shroud x2}
  The Solar may activate this charm after a successful Read Intentions action. She activates Hearth-Eclipsing Shroud reflexively (paying the normal cost), basing her persona solely on satisfying the needs of the person whose intentions she read.

  If she knows Flashing Ruse Prana, she may pay an additional 5m to make an immediate Disguise attempt. Her target will not notice her changing appearance, only that the person in front of him matches what he was looking for even more closely than he thought.

  {Stealth 4, Blinding Battle Feint}

  This charm may be activated at any time. As long as she moves slowly, the Solar may make Stealth attempts even if there's no cover, and gains (Essence) automatic successes on all Stealth rolls. The effect pauses if she moves quickly - an attack or combat movement renders her visible again until her next turn. If she's struck by an attack, the charm ends.

  \charm{Mental Invisibility Technique}
  {5m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{One scene}{Mute}
  {Stealth 4, Essence 2, Easily-Overlooked Presence Method}

  {Reflexive}{One scene}{Mute, Stackable}
  {Stealth 5, Essence 3, Blurred Form Style, Mental Invisibility Technique}
  This charm may be activated at any time. The Exalt chooses hearing, smell (and taste) or touch. She becomes, accordingly, completely silent, scentless, or impossible to recognize by touch - even a blood hound can't smell her, or someone bumping into her in a dark room wouldn't notice.

  This charm may be active twice, banishing her presence from two senses, but not all three.

She rolls (Dexterity + Stealth) against her attacker's (Perception + Awareness), and if successful slips out of harm's way, concealing herself (if there's cover available within Close range) and leaving either thin air or a clever substitution to be struck in her place. Her attacker resets to base initiative.

  This charm may be activated whenever the Solar is concealed.

  Everyone who successfully escapes by using her rolls ends up in the same hiding place, which is somehow large enough to accommodate them all, regardless of how impossible it seems. All attempts to locate them fail until they leave hiding or the Solar ends the charm - searchers miss them no matter how careful, scrying fails to locate them, the Loom of Fate reports that they no longer exist.

\begin{sidebar}{Multiple Familiars}
  While the Familiar background can be taken as many times as is reasonable, there are some considerations for players (especially the Storyteller) to keep in mind, especially when said familiars are designed for battle. A character's bond with her familiar is very personal and important. It's easier to maintain ties like that with one or a very few people than a large group. Also, don't forget to use battle groups to represent gatherings of similar combatants - such as a character's menagerie of pets.

  \par\vspace{6pt} If the Solar has more than one familiar, any Permanent charms she purchases enhance all of them. Simple, Reflexive or Supplemental charms that enhance her familiar can be used to enhance any of them (she chooses which one when activating them). Limited use effects, like Spirit-Tied Pet's once per day mote regeneration, may still only be used once per day, rather than once per day per familiar.

  \charm{Food-Gathering Exercise}
  {3m}
  {Simple}{Instant}{-}
  {Survival 1}
  The Solar spends an hour foraging and hunting for food and water. The amount she gathers depends on the terrain - in verdant woodlands, enough to feed several dozen people for a day, in a prairie or mountains enough for a dozen, and in a barren desert or frozen tundra, two or three people. Double the amount if she has a bow, net, or other appropriate tools.

  \charm{Friendship with Animals Approach}
  {3m}
  {Simple}{One scene}{-}
  {Survival 2}
  Herbivores and small omnivores are no longer afraid of the Exalt, and will become docile enough in her presence that she can pet or handle them. Predators will allow her to pass unharmed through their territory without alarm. This charm doesn't work on sapient creatures or animals maddened by hunger or pain, nor on animals trained to attack.

  \permanentCharm{Spirit-Tied Pet}
  {Survival 3, Friendship with Animals Approach}
  The Solar's familiar gains the a Defining Tie of loyalty to her. Any social influence which would weaken or go against this Intimacy is an unacceptable order. Once/Day, she may touch it to draw 5m or 1wp from their bond to restore herself.

  She may spend a moment's concentration to settle herself in her familiar's mind, regardless of distance. Until she returns to her own body (a reflexive action) she shares its senses, rendering her incapable of taking any other action. She may also communicate simple desires across this link (such as "bring me those keys," "explore the enemy camp" or "kill that person").

  With an Essence 3+ repurchase, while sharing the senses of her familiar the Solar may activate any Stealth charms she knows on its behalf. Circumstance penalties (such as for being large, unusual or unsuitable for stealth) may apply.

  \charm{Hardship-Surviving Mendicant Spirit}
  {5m}
  {Reflexive}{Indefinite}{-}
  {Survival 3}
  This charm may be activated at any time. The Solar ignores all environmental penalties to survival rolls. Cold and heat alike are perfectly comfortable for her. She does not suffer from heat stroke, hypothermia, bug bites, plant poisons or similar harmful or uncomfortable environmental effects.

  With an Essence 3+ repurchase, this charm becomes more powerful - she can withstand the heat and toxic fumes in the caldera of an active volcano, breathe underwater, and explore even the hostile environments of the Elemental Poles without danger. Reduce the damage from all environmental sources of damage by her Resistance or Survival rating, which ever's higher.

  \charm{Trackless Region Navigation}
  {5m, 1wp}
  {Reflexive}{Indefinite}{-}
  {Survival 4, Essence 2, Hardship-Surviving Mendicant Spirit}
  This charm may be activated at any time. The Exalt can find her way safely through even the harshest terrain, leading a group of up to (Essence) Size (if they were a battle group). Enemies can still instigate trouble such as such as rock slides, wildfires, or sudden floods, but her group won't encounter them sheerly by accident. They can cover at least ten miles per day through the harshest of environments, or twenty miles per day through normal wilderness. She automatically succeeds at any Survival rolls to find oases, natural shelter, a river or similar similarly important topographical features.

  \charm{Unshakeable Bloodhound Technique}
  {4m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Survival 5, Essence 2, Trackless Region Navigation}
  This charm supplements a Survival roll for tracking, granting it double 7s. Reduce any penalties from the age of the trail in inclement weather by three.

  \charm{Familiar-Honing Instruction}
  {4m}
  {Reflexive}{One round}{-}
  {Survival 3, Essence 2, Spirit-Tied Pet}

  {Survival 3, Essence 2, Familiar-Honing Instruction}

  {Supplemental}{One extended roll}{-}
  {Survival 4, Essence 2, Spirit-Tied Pet}
  This charm supplements an extended roll to train an animal, whether for simple obedience or tricks, or for unlocking its innate abilities. Reduce the time required for each roll by one interval (months -> weeks, weeks -> days), and the Solar gets (Essence) automatic successes on each roll. She does not need a specialty relevant to the particular animal she's training (falconry, lion taming, etc).

  At Essence 3+, using this charm also allows her to train any familiar (not just her own) with magical abilities (p. 563).

  \charm{Bestial Traits Technique}
  {10m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{Instant}{Once/Familiar per Attribute}
  {Survival 4, Essence 2, Beast-Mastering Behavior}
  The Solar spends a week training her familiar. Increase its Strength, Dexterity, Stamina or Perception by 1, to a maximum of ten.

  With a repurchase, she may instead train its Athletics, Brawl, Integrity, Larceny, Martial Arts, Performance, Resistance, Stealth or Survival by one dot. Each Ability may be raised to a maximum of the Exalt's rating. A familiar who's had this charm used on them five times increases its rating by one dot, and if it's used ten or more times, by two dots.

  {6m}
  {Simple}{Indefinite}{-}
  {Survival 5, Essence 3, Traceless Passage}
  The Solar spends five minutes camouflaging anything (including herself) less than (Essence + 1) yards wide. She rolls (Intelligence + Survival) with double 7s. As long as her subject doesn't move, anyone else must succeed on a (Perception + Awareness) roll at this difficulty to notice it - not even blundering right through the middle of her group or cache of goods will reveal it unless they succeed on the roll.

  \charm{Red-Toothed Execution Order}
  {5m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Once/Scene}
  {Survival 5, Essence 3, Deadly Onslaught Coordination}

  {3m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}

  {15m, 1wp}
  {Reflexive}{Until Familiar Crashes}{Once/Scene}

    \item It gains (Solar's Essence) automatic successes on all Athletics rolls, and reduces the strength minimum for Feats of Strength by the same amount.
    \item It gains (Solar's Essence) bonus dice on all withering and decisive attacks, and on Withering damage rolls. Its base Initiative increases by 3.
    \item It gains 5 soak and (Solar's Essence) -0 health levels. These health levels disappear when the charm ends, taking any damage they've sustained with them.
    \item It rolls Join Battle immediately, replacing its current Initiative with the rolled successes if they're higher (use this to determine how long the charm lasts outside of battle).
  \end{itemize}

  At the end of each round, the familiar loses 1i.

  \charm{Precision of the Striking Raptor}
  {1m}

  \charm{Cascade of Cutting Terror}
  {5m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Once/Scene}
  {Thrown 4, Triple Distance Attack Technique}
  This charm supplements a Decisive Thrown attack, creating hundreds of phantom copies of the weapon as it flies. She applies a full Excellency, and does damage dice equal to twice her Initiative to all objects and insignificant opponents within Close range of her target (including any battle groups).

  If she uses this in the first round of combat and she's the first to act, it gains the Quickshot keyword.

  \charm{Swarm-Culling Instinct}
  {2m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Thrown 4, Essence 2, Steel Storm Descending}

  {4m}
  {Supplemental}{(Essence) turns}{Mute}
  {Thrown 4, Essence 2, Joint-Wounding Attack}
  This charm supplements a Decisive Thrown attack against a single target.

  {3m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Mute}

  {Simple}{Instant}{-}
  {Thrown 5, Essence 2, Cascade of Cutting Terror}
  The Lawgiver makes a Withering Thrown attack. If it deals damage, all enemies within Short range of that target lose (Solar's Essence) Initiative.

    \charm{War God Descendent}
  {3m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {War 1}
  This charm supplements a Strategic Maneuver roll. The Solar ignores the -1 penalty for troops with poor drill, and upon engaging in battle, battle groups under her command count as having +1 size.

  \charm{League of Iron Preparation}
  {5m}
  {Simple}{Instant}{-}
  {War 3, War God Descendent}
  The Solar spends at least a week training her troops with privation and hardship. They are immune to the Demoralize strategem, and their morale barely suffers from hunger, bad weather or physical exhaustion. Their leader ignores penalties due to these factors on Strategic Maneuver rolls.

Increase their drill by one rank, and raise any of their traits to match those of either combat ready troops (p. 496) or elite troops (p. 497) to match their new drill. Any characters in the group that track experience (such as player characters) must spend XP as normal for any stats they wish to increase in this way.

  With an Essence 3+ repurchase, the Lawgiver may also spend a month training Elite troops, granting one of the following bonuses. A single battle group may only benefit from one of these at a time.
  \begin{itemize}

  {Reflexive}{Instant}{-}
  {War 4, Essence 2, Rout-Stemming Gesture}

  \charm{General of the All-Seeing Sun}
  {4m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {War 4, Essence 2, Holistic Battle Understanding}
  This charm supplements a Strategic Maneuver roll, allowing the Solar to select up to (Essence or 2, whichever's greater) strategems at the same time. If she wins the roll, she may spend her threshold successes on as many of her chosen strategems as they can support.

  {Reflexive}{Instant}{-}
  {War 4, Essence 2, Ideal Battle Knowledge Prana}
  This charm may be activated whenever a battle group under the Solar's command reduces the size of an opposing battle group. She rolls Join Battle and adds the result to her current Initiative.

  \charm{Glorious General's Charge}
  {3m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}

  {Reflexive}{Instant}{Once/Scene}
  {War 5, Essence 3, Magnanimity of the Unstoppable Icon}
  This charm may be activated at any time. The Solar makes an immediate Rally for Numbers action with (Essence) automatic successes. If her rolled successes would restore more points of magnitude than the battle group has, it gains that many additional temporary magnitude points, as animals, local spirits, or even the trees themselves answer her call. These extra points of magnitude - and extra troops - fade away at the end of the scene.

  \permanentCharm{Four Glories Meditation}
  {War 5, Essence 3, General of the All-Seeing Sun}
  The Solar's War rolls gain disappearing 6s.

  {War 5, Essence 4, Supremacy Of The Divine Army}
  This Charm supplements a Command action, allowing the Solar to apply it to up to (Essence + 1) battle groups and eliminating any communication difficulties that would result from distance or the noise of the battlefield. The command given must be more or less the same for each unit, although there is some flexibility - when ordering units to attack, it's not necessary that they all attack the same target. If different modifiers would apply to different units, as in the case where Drill varies, use the lowest applicable dice pool.

  \charm{Hell-Conquering Legion Spirit}
  {6m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {War 5, Essence 4, Magnanimity of the Unstoppable Icon}
  This charm supplements the defense of a battle group under the Solar's command against unnatural mental influence, mind, body or soul twisting effects, curses or supernatural environmental hazards.

\chapter{Martial Arts}
\begin{multicols}{2}
Creation's martial arts are the stuff of legend, powerful fighting styles that emulate the ferocity of mighty beasts or follow paths of esoteric wisdom. Martial artists come in many forms throughout the world. The vast majority are mortal men and women who've attained extraordinary martial prowess through intense study, discipline, and training. In the hands of the Exalted, the martial arts rise to even greater peaks of power, allowing supernatural martial artists to harmonize themselves fully with the Essence of a style to master its full potential.

\subsection*{Styles}
  There is no singular "Martial Arts" Ability. Instead, there are many of them, each representing a specific discipline. A character never has dots in "Martial Arts", only in specific styles - Snake, Tiger, Dreaming Pearl Courtesan, or many others. Whenever the book refers to Martial Arts, it means all styles - a character that favors Martial Arts gains a discount when purchasing dots and charms of any style, a character with Supernal Martial Arts treats her essence as 5 for the purposes of buying any style's charms, etc.

  Each style is limited in the weapons and armor that can be used with it. A character may only make attacks or parries using a style ability or activate style charms while armed with weapons and wearing armor appropriate to the style (or while unarmed and/or unarmored, as most styles allow style). Artifact weapons and armor are always compatible with styles their mundane equivalents can be used with.

  \par When a character arms or armors herself inappropriately for a style, she ends any active charms from that style.

\subsection*{Mastery and Terrestrial}
  While all beings capable of wielding essence learn the same martial arts charms, not all beings are equally puissant, and some are more able to take advantage of the enlightenment these charms represent.

  Some charms in this chapter have a Mastery or Terrestrial section, denoting that the charm has a greater or lesser effect when used by different Exalts. Solars and Abyssals always receive the Mastery benefit, while Sidereals have their own esoteric methods for accessing these effects. Dragon-Blooded take the lesser effects given in a charm's Terrestrial section, though certain masters of the Immaculate Order have developed initiations to overcome this limitation.

\end{multicols}

\begin{Ability}{Snake Style}
  Snake style is swift and agile, moving with the speed of a striking serpent to fell stronger or better-armed foes before they even have a chance to act. Its strikes emphasize precision over brute strength, and a master of the style can pierce through armor, paralyze an enemy with a pressure-point strike, or even deliver poisonous Essence through her fingertips. It flourishes in dojos of the South and the East, where students learn to emulate the motion and tactics of the native serpents, but as one of the ancient animal styles whose lineage dates back to the First Age, its practitioners can be found throughout all of Creation.

  \subsection*{Weapons and Armor}
  Snake style may be practiced unarmored or in light armor. Its unarmed attacks are usually two-fingered fang attacks that stab at pressure points and exposed tendons. It can also be used armed with a seven-section staff or hooked sword, which are wielded with extraordinary speed and finesse.

  \charm{Serpentine Evasion}
  {2m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Post-Roll, Advantage}

  {3m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Advantage}
  {Snake 3, Essence 1}
  This charm supplements a Snake attack, increasing the raw damage of a withering attack by (Dexterity) or a decisive attack by 1. If the enemy is crashed, increase a withering attack's minimum damage by the same amount, or for a decisive, the added die changes to a success.

  \textbf{Mastery}: Count the martial artist's Initiative as (Essence + 2) higher than it is to determine if she has Advantage.

  \charm{Snake Form}
  {8m}
  {Simple}{One Scene}{Form}
  {Snake 4, Essence 1, Serpentine Evasion, Striking Cobra Technique}
  The martial artist adds (Dexterity) to her soak. Enemies suffer a -1 penalty on attack rolls against the martial artist, or -3 if she has Advantage over them. She may activate this charm reflexively whenever she makes a withering attack that grants her Advantage over an opponent (where she didn't previously have it).

  With an Essence 2+ repurchase, she may spend an additional 1wp when activating this charm to gain an additional +(Essence) soak, and increase the raw damage of all Withering attacks she makes by +2.

  \textbf{Mastery}: The repurchase's damage bonus also applies to Decisive attacks against enemies she has Advantage over.

  {5m, 1wp}

  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Snake 4, Essence 2, Snake Form}
  This charm supplements a decisive Snake attack with one of the following benefits:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Blinding Fang Strike (3i): If she hits, her enemy suffers a -3 penalty on all actions and is blinded for the rest of the scene. He may spend an unflurable miscellaneous action to remove these penalties.
    \item Nerve-Deadening Venom (4i): If she hits, one of the victims arms is paralized for the rest of the scene, and he suffers a -2 penalty on all actions that would normally require the use of both hands.
    \item Withering Venom Paralysis (6i): If she hits, her enemy's lower body is paralzied until the end of the scene, knocking him prone. Even if he succeeds on a Rise from Prone action he can only crawl, treating all terrain as difficult and taking a -3 penalty on movement actions.
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Terrestrial}: The marital artist cannot use Withering Venom Paralysis.

  {Reflexive}{Instant}{-}
  {Snake 4, Essence 2, Snake Form}
  This charm may be activated any time Solar is targeted by an attack from Close range (or further, if she knows and uses Uncoiling Serpent Prana). She clashes the attack with a Snake attack of her own. If she clashes with a withering attack, she does not gain any initiative even if she succeeds; if she clashes with a decisive attack, she must attempt a gambit rather than dealing damage.

Until the poison runs its course, she's treated as having Advantage over her victim for the purposes of all snake charms.

  \textbf{Terrestrial}: The maximum duration of the poison is 5 rounds.
\end{Ability}

\begin{Ability}{Tiger Style}
  \par Tiger style emulates the ferocious strength and swift, pouncing strikes of the predatory cats. A Tiger stylist treat combat as a dance between predator and prey, pursuing her foe with unmatched speed and unrelenting patience. Once she closes in on her victim, she brings him down like a tiger fells its prey - knocking him to the ground, crippling his limbs, and moving in for the killing strike. Many who follow the path of Tiger style become arrogant, impatient, or cruel, as their trust in their killing power becomes absolute. Others learn different lessons, adapting the patient bearing of a cat stalking its prey through the jungle.

  \subsection*{Weapons and Armor}
  Tiger style uses unarmed attacks - generally raking claws strikes - or tiger claws to slash the flesh of enemies. The style is compatible with light armor.

  {5m}
  {Reflexive}{One Scene}{-}

  The martial artist adds (Strength) to her natural soak and gains (Essence) hardness. She increases both values by +2 against attacks made from long or extreme range.

\begin{Ability}{Dreaming Pearl Courtesan}
  \par Dreaming Pearl Courtesan is a subtle style - graceful, elusive, and lethal. A student learns to maneuver herself into the perfect position to strike, gaining the confidence and trust of her victims as she navigates the veils of defenses they put up between themselves and the world. Once the Dreaming Pearl Courtesan has reached her victim at his most vulnerable - whether that is in the tangle of his boudoir's sheets, a friendly conversation in a tearoom, or a secret meeting at court—she reveals her true nature as a killer, fighting with a deadly grace and the elusiveness of a dream.

  \subsection*{Weapons and Armor}
  Dreaming Pearl Courtesan style must be practiced unarmored. It may be used unarmed or with war fans, whips and elegant improvised weapons, such as weighted sleeves, scarves, hairpins and hand mirrors. When used with the style, the Storyteller should grant them tags as appropriate to their nature.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Disarming: The Disarming tag applies to garments or accessories that can be used to leverage weapons out of their wielder's grip, such as sashes or sleeves. These weapons usually also have the Bashing and Flexible tags.
    \item Grappling: The Grappling tag applies to accessories and garments that could conceivably be used to entangle or tie up an enemy such as the sash of a kimono, a long scarf, a ball gown train, a blanket or sheet, or a length of silken rope. These weapons usually also have the Bashing and Flexible tags.
    \item Piercing: The Piercing tag applies to accessories that are small or sharp enough to slip through the defenses of armor, such as hairpins, cutlery, knitting needles, or elegantly decorated false nails. These weapons usually also have the Lethal tag.
    \item Shield: The Shield tag applies to accessories and garments that seem well-suited to fending off attacks with their broad surface, such as paper fans, hand mirrors, or the long sleeves of a robe. These weapons usually also have the Bashing tag.
  \end{itemize}

  \charm{Pearlescent Filigree Defense}
  {1m}
  {Reflexive}{One scene}{-}
  {Dreaming Pearl 2}
  This charm may be activated at any time. Clothing the martial artist wears hardens and strengthens, counting as mortal light armor which is compatible with this style (but not other styles which forbid armor). In addition, when targeted with a Withering attack, she may spend up to (Appearance) motes, increasing her armor's soak against that attack by that much.

  \textbf{Mastery}: She gains Hardness 10 against the next Decisive attack which targets her. Gain this benefit only once per scene, even if she ends the charm and reactivates it.

  \charm{Demure Carp Feint}
  {3m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Dreaming Pearl 3}

  \textbf{Mastery}: If successful, the opponent(s) she dodged or disengaged from also lose 1i.

  \charm{Elegant Weapon Repertoire}
  {3m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Dreaming Pearl 3}
  This charm supplements a Dreaming Pearl attack. If the attack is Withering, the martial artist adds the accuracy of her weapon to the raw damage. If decisive, she adds +1 to the raw damage. In addition, the martial artist's weapon loses the Improvised tag in her hands until the end of the scene.

  \textbf{Mastery}: Also Increase the weapon's Overwhelming value by 1 until the end of the scene.

  \charm{Dreaming Pearl Courtesan Form}
  {8m}
  {Simple}{One Scene}{Form}
  {Dreaming Pearl 4, Essence 2, Demure Carp Feint, Elegant Weapon Repertoire, Pearlescent Filigree Defense}
  The martial artist may make Dreaming Pearl attacks out to Short range, slashing a fan to create a razor wind, a stash growing long enough to wrap ankles, throwing spikes of energy from her fingertips or similar. Any weapon enhanced by Elegant Weapon Repertoire gains the traits of a light artifact weapon, and any clothing enhanced by Pearlescent Filigree Defense gains the traits of light artifact armor.

  Whenever the martial artist successfully disengages with 5+ successes, she may activate this charm reflexively.

  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Group, Once/Scene}

  \textbf{Mastery}: The duration of this charm is "one round", affecting all opposed actions it could be applied to.

  \charm{Flurry of August Leaves}
  {3m, 1wp}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{-}
  {Dreaming Pearl 4, Essence 2, Dreaming Pearl Courtesan Form}
  This charm supplements a Decisive Dreaming Pearl attack or Gambit. The martial artist chooses a benefit that matches one of her weapon's tags:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Disarming: If she is making a Disarm gambit and it succeeds, she flings her opponent's weapon out to Long range, and ignores the Initiative cost.
    \item Shield: In addition to the attack, she makes an immediate Full Defense action, ignoring the Initiative cost.
    \item Piercing: If her attack hits, she ignores any soak and hardness from her target's armor for her next two turns.
    \item Grappling: If she is making a Grapple gambit and and it hits, she ignores the Initiative cost and draws her target in to Close range if he's further away. She may roll (Initiative + Essence) on the control roll if it's higher than her usual pool.
  \end{itemize}

  \charm{Vindictive Concubine's Pillow Book}
  {7m}
  {Supplemental}{Instant}{Post-Roll}
  {Dreaming Pearl 5, Essence 3, Flurry of August Leaves}
  This charm supplements a Decisive Dreaming Pearl attack after it's hit, granting the damage roll double Xs, where X is (10 - number of criteria met), to a maximum of double 7s.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item The martial artist is making an Ambush attack against a target who knows her personally.
    \item She knows something about his personal life or dealings that would be embarassing or ruinous to him, and he knows that she knows it.
    \item She stole Initiative from him last round with Fragrant Petal Fascination Kata this or last round.
    \item She succeeded on an action or defense using Seven Storms Escape Prana this or last round.
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Terrestrial}: This charm may only be used Once/Scene.

  \textbf{Mastery}: Being in Dreaming Pearl Courtesan Form counts as an additional criteria. If she meets at least 4 criteria, she gains 1i after the attack (after resetting to base, if it hits).

  \begin{sidebar}{...What?}
    Invoking the Chimera's Coils, the last charm in this ability, is rather strange. Monstrous transformations, divine auras, the potential threat of unwanted enlightenment - this type of thing is the high-water mark for how strange martial arts can get. Other styles might feature powerful capstones that reach similar levels of esoteric effects and bizarre powers, but those are exceptions rather than the norm. Storyellers who find it too weird of an ending to an otherwise sensible Martial Art may wish to allow players (or their NPCs) to purchase the alternate version of the charm instead.
  \end{sidebar}

  \charm{Invoking the Chimera's Coils}
  {8m, 1wp}
  {Reflexive}{One Scene}{-}
  {Dreaming Pearl 5, Essence 3, Seven Storms Escape Prana, Vindictive Concubine's Pillow Book}
  The martial artist may activate this charm at the start of her turn when she is in Dreaming Pearl Courtesan Form and either she has Initiative 15+ or no undamaged -2 health levels. Her neck lengthens as she grows to five times her normal height, while her head becomes that of a delicate, gold-beaked foal with four sets of spiraling horns. Her arms and legs vanish, replaced with opalescent fins like those of a carp hold her new form aloft in the air. Countless eyes run down either side of her narrow snout and continue down her back, ranging from the size of small pearls to that of goose eggs, blazing like sapphires in the noonday sun.

  She flies effortlessly, and her natural soak increases by (Essence). She may not make attacks with abilities other than Dreaming Pearl (including attacks created by Reflexive charms). Other Dreaming Pearl Courtesan charms are enhanced:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Pearlescent Filigree Defense: The enhanced clothing gains an additional +3 soak and hardness.
    \item Demure Carp Feint: The bonuses it provides do not count against the normal charm dice adding limits.
    \item Elegant Weapon Repertoire: Rather than using props to make this attack, she can use dream-like ephemera of any imaginable form (with no more than one tag per attack). Add an additional +3 raw damage.
    \item Fragrant Petal Fascination Kata: She steals an additional 2i from each opponent whose Resolve is overcome.
    \item Seven Storms Escape Prana: This charm may now supplement any movement action (including those unopposed), allowing her to ignore intervening barriers and hazards as she dissolves into pastel fumes and reappears at her destination in a vortex of swirling light.
    \item Flurry of August Leaves: Add up to (Appearance) threshold successes on the attack roll to the damage roll.
    \item Vindictive Concubine's Pillow Book: The damage roll gains disappearing 1s.
  \end{itemize}

  If she suffers any damage to a -4 health level, she becomes so caught up in her dream that she vanishes from the world entirely, never to be seen again.

  \textbf{Terrestrial}: If she ends her turn below 10 Initiative and didn't hit with a Decisive attack or gambit on her turn, the charm ends.

  \textbf{Mastery}: When activating this charm for the first time in a scene, she rolls Join Battle using (Appearance + Performance), adding to her existing initiative total.

  \charm{Invoking the Chimera's Coils (Alternate Version)}
  {8m, 1wp}
  {Simple}{One Scene}{Perilous}
  {Dreaming Pearl 5, Essence 3, Seven Storms Escape Prana, Vindictive Concubine's Pillow Book}
  The martial artist may activate this charm while at 10+ Initiative and in Dreaming Pearl Courtesan Form, and ends if she leaves the form. She becomes dreamlike and luminous, seeming to fade in and out of reality like a half-remembered dream. Her other Dreaming Pearl charms are enhanced:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Pearlescent Filigree Defense: While this charm is active, withering damage rolls against her gain penalized 1s.
    \item Demure Carp Feint: If successful, she gains 2i (and her target loses 2i, if Mastery applies).
    \item Elegant Weapon Repertoire: This charm's duration changes to "One Scene", applying all of its benefits to every attack. Her weapons seem as insubstantial as the martial artist, barely present.
    \item Fragrant Petal Fascination Kata: She steals an additional 1i from each opponent whose Resolve is overcome.
    \item Seven Storms Escape Prana: Reduce the cost of this charm by 2m. She may spend initiative she doesn't have on it, taking her into the negative (or further into it).
    \item Flurry of August Leaves: Following impossible dream logic, she may grant her weapon any of the four tags even if it doesn't normally have it.
    \item Vindictive Concubine's Pillow Book: The damage roll gains disappearing 1s.
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Terrestrial}: If she ends her turn below 10 Initiative and didn't hit with a Decisive attack or gambit on her turn, the charm ends.

  \textbf{Mastery}: This charm loses the Perilous keyword.
